*******                           What is WDF?                          *******
*******************************************************************************

This file describes the WDF format. WDF is an abbreviation of either
"Wiimms Disc File" or shorter "Wii Disc File".

To avoid misunderstandings: WDF will not replace WBFS. It is only a way to
shrink ISO images (reduces the disk usage) on other file systems like ext2,
FAT or NTFS. And while adding/extracting a WDF image to/from WBFS the
transformation can be done on the fly without time costs.

Wii ISO images has a size of about 4.4 GiB, but much space is unused and have
to be filled with zeros. Some games need less than 100 MiB and that means
about 4.3 GiB waste. The linux ext2/3 file system can handle such files very
good because it do not allocate disk space for such (zero-)holes. Such files
called "sparse files".

For me there is no need to store Wii ISO images in the old way filled with
zeros. And the handling with large sparse files is not effective and needs
always special options like 'ls -s' or 'cp --sparse=always'. Also it costs
much time because the holes have to be scanned again.

One way is to compress the data. But compressing works only for the holes but
not for the crypt data. And random access (needed by the WBFS subsystem) is
very difficult for compressed data. The direct support of holes seems to be
much better.

Because of this all I have defined a new file format, the WDF format. There
are some main issues for me:

 1.) The WDF format should handles holes effectivly to save disk space.

 2.) It should support splitted files because small files can sometimes be
     handled more effectivly than one whole large files.

 3.) There must be a WBFS tool to handle this kind of files. I have already
     implemented the WDF support im my 'wwt' (Wiimms WBFS Tool).
     The WWT package contains some more tools to handle WDF directly.

 4.) Other WBFS manager should support the WDF too. And this means that the
     implementation must be done by the well known wrapper functions
     'rw_sector_callback_t' and 'read_wiidisc_callback_t'. That makes
     transfering the code very easy.

*******                       Tests and statistics                      *******
*******************************************************************************

I have already implemented the WDF support in my tool 'WWT' and tested it with
many games. In the tests I have converted games from ISO to WDF and back.
I done this with the tools iso2wdf and wdf2iso/wdf-cat and with WBFS import
and export. It work well and have not found any errors.

Additionally I have testet more than 2 million non ISO files without any
failures. This works because WDF may detect holes in any files. For tests I
use the script: http://wiimm.de/r/wwt/scripts/test-wdf-tools.sh

*******************************************************************************
*******                     Tools that supports WDF                     *******
*******************************************************************************

At the moment only the tools from WWT (Wiimms WBFS Tool) will support WDFS:
 - Tool 'wwt' may import WDF files directly to a WBFS
   and may export discs from WBFS directly to WDF files.
 - Tool 'wdf-dump' dumps the data structure of a WDF file.
 - Tool 'iso2wdf' converts ISO images into WDF files.
 - Tool 'wdf2iso' converts WDF files into ISO images.
 - Tool 'wdf-cat' is a 'cat' like program with special handling of WDF.

See http://wiimm.de/wwt for announcements and discussions.


*******************************************************************************
*******                         Data structures                         *******
*******************************************************************************

First a magic is defined to identify a WDF clearly. The magic should never be
a possible Wii ISO image identification. Wii ISO images starts with the ID6.
And so the WDF magic contains one control character (CTRL-A) within.

    #define WDF_MAGIC       "WII\1DISC"
    #define WDF_MAGIC_SIZE  8
    #define WDF_VERSION     1

A WDF file contains 3 parts (splittet files wil be discussed later):

    WDF header      (struct WDF_Header_t, including WDF_MAGIC)
    data chunks     (pure data, unstructured)
    WDF_MAGIC       (the MAGIC again)
    WDF chunk table (struct WDF_Chunk_t)

The WDF header has an constant size and can be written as dummy and before
closing rewritten with the needed data. The chunk data is written 1:1. The
chunk control informations are collected an will be written at the end of the
file. There are some redundant information. They can be used for plausibility
checks. Remember: All data is stored in network byte order (big endian).

    typedef struct WDF_Head_t
    {
        // the magic
        char magic[WDF_MAGIC_SIZE]; // WDF_MAGIC, what else!
        u32 wdf_version;            // WDF_VERSION

        // split file support
        u32 split_file_id;          // random number, for plausibility checks
        u32 split_file_index;       // zero based index ot this file
        u32 split_file_num_of;      // total number of split files

        // virtual file infos
        u64 file_size;              // the size of the virtual file

        // data size of this file
        u64 data_size;              // the ISO data size in this file
                                    // (without header and chunk table)
        // chunks
        u32 chunk_split_file;       // which split file contains the chunk table
        u32 chunk_n;                // total number of data chunks
        u64 chunk_off;              // the  'MAGIC + chunk_table' file offset

    } WDF_Head_t;

The 'split_*' fields are described below.
The 'file_size' contains the total size of the virtual ISO image.
The 'data_size' defines the total data size in current split file.
The 'chunk_off' data points to the file offset of the table.

    typedef struct WDF_Chunk_t
    {
        u32 split_file_index;       // which split file conatins that chunk
        u64 file_pos;                // the virtual ISO file position
        u64 data_off;               // the data file offset
        u64 data_size;              // the data size

    } WDF_Chunk_t;

The chunk table (WDF_Chunk_t) is always sorted by the iso_pos_* in ascending
order so that a lookup can be done by a binary search.

There is always a chunk at virtual ISO file position #0 an one chunk that
reaches the end of the virtual file. If there are holes at the beginning or
end of the data than chunks with data_size==0 bytes have to be insertet.

This is an example dump of the game "Animal Crossing". The dump was created
with the tool 'wdf-dump' which is part of 'wwt' (Wiimms WBFS Tool).

*******************************************************************************
*******                            Split files                          *******
*******************************************************************************

There is only a small need for splitted files, e.g. when transporting a large
image via a FAT file system. The WDF splits the data anyway in chunks. So it
is only a little step to devide the chunks into more than 1 file.

---------------------
 Parameter overview:
---------------------

 WDF_Head_t:
    split_file_id     : any (random) value, but same in all files.
    split_file_index  : unique index [0..]
    split_file_num_of : Total number of split files [1..]
    chunk_split_file  : Index of file which contais the chunk table.

 WDF_Chunk_t
    split_file_index  : Index of split fle where the chunk data resides.


---------------------
 Here are the rules:
---------------------

 * Each file of the (splitted) set contains the same header at the beginning
   of the file. The only difference in the headers is the 'split_file_index',
   a zero based index.

 * 'split_file_num_of' gives the numer of files in the set. 'split_file_index'
   is always smaller than 'split_file_num_of'.

 * 'split_file_id' may have any (random) value but must be same in all files.

 * The chunk table is stored in the split file with index 'chunk_split_file'.

 * Each chunk has a parameter called 'split_file_index' which declares in which
   file the chunk data resides.

 * The filename of split file #0 is the base name. The filenames of all other
   split files have the identical base name plus '.' plus an decimal index
   taken from 'split_file_index' without any padding.

    Example:
	file #0:  my_game.wdf
	file #1:  my_game.wdf.1
	file #2:  my_game.wdf.2
	  ...
	file #9:  my_game.wdf.9
	file #10: my_game.wdf.10


---------------------
    Style guide:
---------------------

Here are some rules how to write a good splitted WDF. Assume that the user has
set a limit for each file. No file schould be larger than this limit.

 * Open the first file (index #0) and write a dummy header to that file.

 * While writing chunks check if the limit will be exceeded.
   If so:
    - Split the current chunk into 2 chunks: The first chunks contains enough
      data to reach the limit. The second chunk takes the remaining data.
    - Open the next split file with a filename described above and write a
      dummy header to that file.

 * If all data is written then:
    - Calculate the chunk tables size including the magic. If the data will
      execeed the limit open a new split file and write the dummy header.
    - Write the chunk table to the current file (remember: network byte order).
    - Calculate the header and write it to all data files. Don't forget the
      individual 'split_file_index' and the network byte order.
    - Close all files.


REMARK:
 The WWT tools supports splitted WDF files *not* following this rules. The
 files are splitted hard by breaking the files into peaces. This is done by
 the file layer so that the WDF layer don't see the split.
