wit v2.00a r2834 - 2011-07-08

 - Because no bugs (exclude installing) reported since months my WIT tools
   seems to be perfect (or ready to use or something between). So it's time
   to increase the major version and to proclaim v2.00a. The whole project
   consists about 100 000 code lines.
 - Bug fix for Windows install script: Remove duplicate WIT entries.


wit v2.00b r2855 - 2011-07-13
 - Bug fix: If creating a Wii image and using hard links (option --links) the
   offsets of some hard linked files are wrong for some special situations.


wit v2.01a r3138 - 2011-10-27

 - Windows version only: Update to Cygwin DLL 1.7.9-1
 - Bug fix (thanx to fig2k4): Special characters in FST file names with code
   >127 will now be translated into UTF-8 to list and create files correct.
 - New option for "wwt LIST": --fragments: Print fragments and a ratio instead
   of the region info. A summary line is printed too.
 - New command: wwt LIST-F|LF: Short cut for "wwt LIST --fragments"
 - Option --sort=fragments sort some listings by the number of wbfs fragments.
 - Option --fast is ignored and will be removed in the near future.
   Please don't use --fast any longer.
 - New option: --copy-gc: If extracting a GameCube disc image, don't extract
   the real files to '/files/...'. Instead create a copy of the source image
   and store it as 'game.iso'. If the source image have the correct format and
   option --no-link is not set, try a hard link first.
 - Option --neek replaces the old --sneek, but --sneek is also accepted.
   Option --neek includes now option --copy-gc.
 - "wit extract --neek --dest %i": Extract like DiscEx (but faster!).
   The only change is for GameCube discs because of implied --copy-gc.


Known bugs:

 - There are new problems while reading from non seekable sources (e.g. pipes).
   The reason is the complete new and more intelligent wiidisc lib which makes
   more lookups ==> The best is to use version 1.01c for pipes.


Road map (for some point in the future):

 I have already stopped the development in favor of my SZS tools. But there
 are some already planned extensions:

 - Since many versions the code contains a WBFS extension, enabled by defining
   the symbol NEW_WBFS_INTERFACE (set by "make new all"). If enabled, the free
   blocks table is managed in a total different way. Already implemented are:
    - WBFS access: While opening a WBFS the free blocks table is ignored.
      Instead of using the stored one an internal memory map of used blocks is
      built. This needs only a part of a second. Some advantages:
       - Errors in the free blocks table are irrelevant.
       - Blocks overlaps and invalid block assignings are automatically
         detected and reported.
       - If removing a discs with overlaps, the blocks are still marked used.
       - Blocks, that are not handled by the free blocks tables (a result of a
         calculation bug in the original libwbfs) can be used.
      If closing, a new (and corrected) free blocks table will be written. This
      makes the whole process compatible to other WBFS managers and loaders.
    - wwt ADD: Before adding a disc it size is compared against the free size
      of the WBFS. This allows an early "disc full" error message.
    - wwt ADD: If adding a disc a continuous memory block is searched to
      minimize the (non existent) fragmentation.
   Missing:
    - Report errors while scanning the WBFS.
    - The commands "wwt CHECK", "wwt REPAIR" and "wwt EDIT" must use the new
      interface.

 - GameCube support is still incomplete.
    - Creation of GameCube disc is not possible.
    - Skeleton support missed.

 - There are already code fragments implemented to trim discs in three levels:
    - Move partitions as whole to eliminate disc holes.
    - Move partition sectors to reduce partition size (alternative for
      partition scrubbing). Fake signing is necessary.
    - Move files of partitons to optimize the step above a little.
   For all trimming levels alignment factors may be set and it should be
   possible to set special alignments for GameCube sound files.

 - On the fly patching: Create a new image a combination of 2 or more sources.
   Therefor trimming is needed.
