wit v1.00a r1214 - 2010-06-12

 - Because I finished my work with wwt (the WBFS manager) it's time to
   declare Version 1.00. The tool wit is still under development.
 - This is the last version which supports the three tools iso2wbfs, iso2wdf
   and wdf2iso. Use the more powerful command 'wit copy' instead.
 - Makefile changes:
    - File './include-local' is not included anymore. Instead the file
      'makefiles-local/Makefile.local.$(SYSTEM)' is included.
    - make chmod: change mode 775/644 for known dirs and files.
    - make chown: change owner of all dirs+files to owner of '.'.
    - make chgrp: change group of all dirs+files to group of '.'.
    - make ch+  := make chmod chown chgrp
 - wit DUMP: Output improved.
 - wit DUMP can now dump data structure of Wii ISO files, ticket.bin (new!),
   tmd.bin (new!), header.bin (new!), boot.bin, fst.bin and of DOL-files.
   The file type is detected automatically by analyzing the content.

wit v1.00b r1218 - 2010-06-12  (repository only)

 - The tools iso2wbfs, iso2wdf and wdf2iso have been removed. Use wit instead.

wit v1.01a r1245 - 2010-06-20

 - CISO support: The new options --chunk-mode, --chunk-size and --max-chunks
   gives the user the control over chunk size when creating a CISO file.
 - With release v0.37 I have written a complete new function to calculate the
   WBFS geometry (outsourcing of the calculation so that other commands can use
   the results). Up to now the new and the old calculation have been compared
   on every WBFS formatting. From now only this new calculation is used.
 - wit DUMP --long: Print content of TICKET and TMD too.
 - New option for wit DUMP: --show=keylist: This option allows fine control
   over the things that should be printed. If set --long is ignored. Allowed
   keywords: NONE, ALL, INTRO, P-TAB, P-INFO, P-MAP, D-MAP, TICKET, TMD,
   PART (=P-INFO|P-MAP|TICKET|TMD), MAP (=P-MAP|D-MAP).
   If --show is set option --long is ignored.
 - wit+wwt VERIFY --long --long: Hex dump of 'DATA' was wrong.
 - Bug fix for option --pmode: keyword INDEX is enabled now.
 - New warnings (exit status): "Nothing to do" and "No source file found".

wit v1.01b r1248 - 2010-06-20

 - Bug fix for "wit DUMP":
    - If neither --show nor --long is set the head parameters was not printed.
    - Indention was wrong.

wit v1.01c r1313 - 2010-07-01

 - Bug fix for "wit COPY": If converting an ISO to a plain iso file (*.iso) in
   scrubbing mode the destination file was truncated to the needed size. Now
   it is extended to 4 699 979 776 bytes again.

wit v1.10a.beta r1333 - 2010-07-05

 - New option: --width wd: Define the width (number of columns) for help and
   other messages and disables the automatic detection of the terminal width.
 - wwt EXTRACT: Support '%X' and '%Y' in output filenames.
 - I have rewritten the wiidisc lib (part of libwbfs) from scratch. It has a
   complete new interface and an improved functionality. It uses dynamic data
   structures and collect data as needed. This has considerable advantages
   for the whole WIT project:
    - All information about a Wii disc is now in one hand. Things like usage
      maps and partition data are loaded/built once and only if needed.
    - wit DUMP --show=files: Print a list with images files (like -F+ before).
      Option --show=offset,size,dec,hex,header controls the output columns.
    - wit DUMP --show=usage: Print a wii sector usage map.
    - wit ILIST: Redesigned. Option --show=offset,size,dec,hex,header,path
      controls the output columns.
    - Option --psel extended:
        --psel=NO-ID : use all partitions but not partitions with an ID type.
        --psel=PTAB0 : use all partitions of table #0 but no other partitions.
        --psel=ALL   : use all partitions (the default).
        --psel=WHOLE : use all partitions and don't scrub partitions
        --psel=RAW   : more than 'WHOLE': copy whole dics
    - wit DIFF: If using the option --psel the partition tables are normalized
      before comparing. This enables DIFF to compare DATA partitions only
      independent from the existence of other partitions.

wit v1.10a.beta r1338 - 2010-07-05  (repos only)

 - Channel partitions (ssbb) enabled, but not tested.
 - The field width of offset and size columns of FST listings is now
   calculated. A space between the columns is guaranteed.
 - wit DUMP: A forgotten endian calculation results in a wrong region info.

wit v1.10a.beta r1359 - 2010-07-09

 - ID renaming: A point ('.') means: leave id character unchanged.
 - Options --ios, --id and --name modify only disc data and the DATA partition,
   but no longer any other partitions.
 - There is an complete new implementation of option --psel: Combinations like
   '--psel DATA,UPDATE' or '--psel -CHANNEL' are supported now.
 - New: wit DUMP --show=patch: Shows a address map with patching infos.
 - wwt EXTRACT: Complete new and improved calculation of output filename.
 - Option --files: Macro calls are now prefixed by a colon (':'). The previous
   prefix '=' is obsolete, but still allowed.
 - Command "wit ILIST" evaluates option --psel now.
 - I have run my test scripts against this release without any reported errors.

wit v1.10a.beta r1363 - 2010-07-09  (repos only)

 - Bug fix: File size calculation error for when composing large discs.

wit v1.10a.beta r1374 - 2010-07-13

 - New wiidisc lib: Advanced error handling.
 - wit ILIST: List files like 'fst.bin' too.

Aggregation of the previous beta versions:

 - New option: --width wd: Define the width (number of columns) for help and
   other messages and disables the automatic detection of the terminal width.
 - I have rewritten the wiidisc lib (part of libwbfs) from scratch. It has a
   complete new interface and an improved functionality. It uses dynamic data
   structures and collect data as needed. This has considerable advantages
   for the whole WIT project.
 - ID renaming: A point ('.') means: leave id character unchanged.
 - Options --ios, --id and --name modify only disc data and the DATA partition,
   but no longer any other partitions.
 - There is an complete new implementation of option --psel: Combinations like
   '--psel DATA,UPDATE' or '--psel -CHANNEL' are supported now.
 - wwt EXTRACT: Complete new and improved calculation of output filename.
 - wwt EXTRACT: Support '%X' and '%Y' in output filenames.
 - Option --files: Macro calls are now prefixed by a colon (':'). The previous
   prefix '=' is obsolete, but still allowed.
 - Bug fix: File size calculation error for when composing large discs.

wit v1.10a r1386 - 2010-07-15

 - wiitdb.com: Support of new languages: ru, zhcn, zhtw
 - wwt ANALYZE: If option --long is set then calculated values are printed too
   if other values are available. If option --long is set twice calculated
   values are always printed.
 - wit+wwt: Option --trunc: Truncate created PLAIN ISO image to needed size.

wit v1.11a.beta r1428 - 2010-07-24

 - Computed line breaks for error messages.
 - "wit COPY" accepts the options --id --name --ios --region to patch the
   image while copying.
 - New command: wit EDIT: Patch ISO images directly without copying.

wit v1.11a r1434 - 2010-07-26

 - Option --region: endian bug fix

wit v1.12a r1451 - 2010-08-01

 - Bug fix for option --sneek: Option --psel was not set in a correct way.
 - New command: wit CREATE TICKET/TMD: Create a ticket or tmd file from
   scratch. Options and parameters control the creation.
 - Composing: If files ticket.bin or tmd.bin missed or have a wrong size
   TICKET and/or TMD will be created automatically.
 - New command: wit MIX: Mix partitions from different sources into one
   new Wii disc image.  *** "wit MIX" is EXPERIMENTAL! ***

wit v1.13a r1468 - 2010-08-04

 - Command "wit MIX" accepts now the option --overlay: Partitions will
   be overlayed so that data from one partition is stored in unused areas
   of a other partition. To find the optimum order a permutation is done.
   Option --overlay limits the number of input partitions to 12, because
   the calculation is rated as O(2^n).  *** "wit MIX" is EXPERIMENTAL! ***
 - "wit MIX" wil accept the keyword 'psel' as alternative to 'select'.
   The reason is that 'select' accepts the same keyword list as --psel.
 - The disc subsystems recognize overlayes partitions. For overlayed
   partitions the --psel keyword "WHOLE" is ignored.
 - Command "wit DUMP" will print an info line for overlayed partitions.

wit v1.14a r1506 - 2010-08-09

 - Option --psel redesigned: it is now possible to allow or deny any partition
   by partition type, partition table and/or by partition index. Only with the
   unambiguous partition index it is possible to select the one wanted DATA
   partition if multiple exists.
 - New option --rm-files: This patching option defines filter rules to remove
   real files and directories from the FST of the DATA partition. Fake signing
   of the TMD is necessary.
 - New option --zero-files: This patching option defines filter rules to zero
   (set size to zero) real files of the FST of the DATA partition. Fake
   signing$ of the TMD is necessary.
 - New option --ignore-files: This option defines filter rules to ignore
   system and real directories and files of the FST of the DATA partition.
   Fake signing is not necessary, but the partition becomes invalid, because
   the content of some files is not copied.
 - New qualifier for "wit MIX": "IGNORE ruleset": Ignore files when copying a
   disc image. See http://wit.wiimm.de/wit/cmd-mix.html#ignore for details.
 - Some modification for expanding '@file' parameters: wit MIX needs control.
 - wit MIX: A new algorithm for 2 partitions: It tries every possible shift to
   find the best overlay. All holes in both partitions are relevant.
 - wit MIX: Before creating the image a additional verify function is called.
   This function controls that no sector is used by more than one partition.
   With verbose level >=3 an usage map is printed too.

wit v1.15a r1554 - 2010-08-15

 - New "wit MIX" qualifer: HEADER: Copy the disc header (first 256 bytes of
   disc) of the related source image to the destination image. Patching with
   the options --id and --name is possible.
 - New "wit MIX" qualifer: REGION: Copy the region infor (32 Bytes at offset
   0x4e000) of the related source image to the destination image. Patching
   with the option --region is possible.
 - Bug fix: "wit mix --name discname" didn't work.
 - Bug fix for "wit mix --overlay".
 - Writing a WBFS file is now part of the file layer and libwbfs is only used
   as helper. Now every command, and also "wit MIX", is able to write to a
   WBFS file like to any other formats without special code.
 - "INSTALLER" is now an alternative name for the "UPDATE" partition, like
   "GAME" for "DATA" since the epoch.
 - To manage allowed and permitted options, 64 bit integer numbers had been
   used. Now arrays will be used, because wwt have already reached the limit
   of 64 command specific options. Hope that all run as before.
 - Korean disc support implemented. (I can't test this by myself)
 - New option: --common-key index: Change the common key index of all partitions
   and fake sign the tickets.
 - I have implemented a new "ID selection interface". It works with positive
   ('+') and negative ('-' or '/') rules. A rule consist up to 6 characters,
   case is ignored. Points ('.') are wildcards for a single character and mult
   ('*') and plus ('+') for many characters. Each source ID6 is compared to
   each rule of the list until a rules matches the ID. If it is a positive rule,
   the ID is inserted into the workig list.
 - The syntax of the commands "wit ID6" and "wwt ID6" have changed to use the
   new "ID selection interface" (see above). More commands will follow.
 - The commands 'wit ILIST/ILIST-L/ILIST-LL' are renamed to 'wit FILES/FILES-L
   /FILES-LL'. The old command names are still allowed.
 - The new command "wit FDIFF" is a shortcut for "wit DIFF --files +".

wit v1.16a r1645 - 2010-09-01

 - wit MIX: Forgotten options: --iso --wdf --ciso --wbfs
 - wit ID6 --long: Print disc title too.
 - wwt ADD: Default is now: --enc encrypt
 - wit DIFF: Will patch the partiton tables for scrubbed diff, because
   different tools modify them in a different way while scrubbing.
 - Bug fix for wwt VERIFY: Iteration through whole WBFS failed.
 - A little change when creating a WBFS file: The hss value in the WBFS header
   is now set to the truncated value.
 - New file format supported: WIA = Wii ISO Archive (EXPERIMENTAL!)
   WIA will decrypt partitions and compress the data in chunks with bzip2.
   Because of the chunks the archive allows random read access to view
   only parts of the image. The option --no-compress disables compressing.
   The resulting image is very effective packable by all compression tools.
 - GameCube ISO support for nearly all commands. (EXPERIMENTAL!)

wit v1.17a r1834 - 2010-10-05

 - The WIA file format was completely redesigned. WIA supports now 5
   compression methods: NONE, PURGE, BZIP2, LZMA and LZMA2.
 - New extended syntax of option --compression: method.level@factor
   'method' is the name (NONE, LZMA, ...) or index of the method. '.level' is
   a point followed by one digit. It defines the compression level. The
   special value '0' means: Use default compression level. '@factor' is a
   factor for the chunk size. With the default factor '1' the chunk size is
   2 MiB (size of 1 Wii sector group). All three fields are optional.
 - I declare the WIA file format stable and hope that converting to and from
   WIA is free of bugs. The best for users is to convert to WIA and back and
   compare the result with the original source.
 - New command: WIT COMPR: Prints a list with supported compression methods.
   With parameters the normalized names of that parameters are printed.
   WIT COMPR accepts the options --long (twice) --no-header and --sections.
 - The new tool 'wdf' should replace the tools wdf-cat, wdf-dump and should
   compensate the old tools wdf2iso and iso2wdf as general wdf converters.
   See built in help for details. The tool 'wdf' is EXPERIMENTAL!
 - Support of GameCube multiboot discs. (EXPERIMENTAL!)
 - New options --align-part: Align partitions while moving or creating them.
 - New options --disc-size: Define a minimal disc size.
 - Command "wit SCRUB" renamed to "wit CONVERT". "wit SCRUB" is still allowed.
 - From now the first 0x50000 bytes of Wii discs will be scanned for non zero
   data. Such data is included into the copy operations. The old and standard
   scrubbing algorithm ignore such sectors in the range 0x08000..0x3ffff.
 - WBFS files with more than 1 disc are not longer detected as ISO images.
 - CYGWIN: Improved support of windows style paths ('X:\path\file').
 - Bug fix: While composing the FST size (var 'max_fst_size4' in 'boot.bin')
   wasn't updated. If you compose an ISO and the resulting FST is bigger than
   the original, the Wii apploader failed.
 - Bug fix: Creation of a WIA file failed if option --psel is set and at least
   one partition was removed (scrubbed). The result was an invalid disc image.
 - Bug fix: "wit MOVE" didn't create the directory path even if --DEST is set.
 - Bug fix for "wit move": wit move have forgotten to move the continuation
   files of splitted images.
 - Bug fix: Non Wii ISO images are not listed any more if the source is a
   directory. This old behavior of wit was lost some releases ago.

wit v1.18a r1868 - 2010-10-10

 - ETA calculation changed to support WIA chunk caching and writing.
 - CYGWIN: The parameters of the options --dest and --DEST are now checked if
   they start with 'X:\' or 'X:/'. These code are replaced by '/cygdrive/X/'.
   This is also done for the last parameter of "wit COPY/MOVE/EXTRACT/DIFF" if
   neither --dest nor --DEST is set and the last parameter is the destination.
 - New option: --unit: Specify the unit for size values. Some possible values
   are BYTES,KB,KIB,1000,1024,AUTO,WII. Read built in help for more details.
 - wit LIST: Support of option --unit to define the unit for the ISO sizes.
 - wit ISOSIZE: Support of option --unit to define the unit for the ISO sizes.
   A summary line is also printed if the lsit contains 2 or more images.
 - Options --include and --exclude accept now a comma separated list of IDs.
 - Bug fix: If wit had closed a WBFS partiton a truncation errors appeared.
 - New wit option: --auto: If set, all devices are scanned for WBFS partitions
   and all WBFS partitions are added to the source list. It replaces parameters
   like "--source /dev/wbfs" and works like "wwt --auto --all".

wit v1.19a r1904 - 2010-10-23

 - Bug fix for "wit EDIT": New hash values were not copied to other sectors
   of the same sector group.
 - "wwt ADD" accepts option "--source source" as alternative source definition.
 - The layout of "wit LIST-LLL" is redesigned:
    - Bug fix for real paths for WBFS files.
    - New option: --real-path: print the real path instead of the entered path.
    - New column: p-info: Print a short info about available partitions: "DUC?"
 - The new command "wit/wwt INFO" will inform about features. The intension is
   to inform GUIs and other wit calling programs. Therefor option --sections
   is also supported. At this moment only supported file formats inclusive
   attributes (read/write/modify/extend/fst) are printed.
 - "wit FILETYPE" and other listing commands: The file types are redefined in
   a more consistence way. ISO images are tagged as 'CONTAINER/DISCTYPE' like
   'ISO/WII', 'WDF/GC', 'WBFS/WII', 'FST/WII'.
 - New option --no-expand: Do not expand directories to the containing files
   or images. This option does not change the behavior of --recurse.
 - New options: --one-job and --job-limit=n: Limit the number of jobs to
   execute. If done without errors the exit status is NULL.
 - Some minor output bug fixes.

wit v1.20a r1945 - 2010-11-05

 - WIA creation warning "WIA is NEW! Compare with original source." removed.
 - Preparation: Tools will read future WDF versions without warnings, if the
   compatibility parameter allow this.
 - The file descriptor of the last WBFS partition is saved/cached. This makes
   wit faster when reading multiple discs from a WBFS.
 - wit EXTRACT: The progress view is now based on the file size instead of
   the file count.
 - Options --include and --exclude accept now IDs with wildcards:
   '.' is a wildcard for 1 character and '*' and '+' (same meaning) for any
   number of characters.
 - File 'setup.txt' is created as template while extracting a disc image.
   It is scanned for ID, NAME and OFFSET while composing a disc image.
   The new option --ignore-setup disables the scanning of 'setup.txt'.
 - Bug fix for "wit CONVERT": The destination path was the current working
   directory.
 - Bug fix for "wwt ADD --remove": If command is done without errors all
   sources files -- but not FST -- are removed.
 - Bug fix: Calculation of fst size fixed for GameCube parsing.
 - Buf fix for "wit CONVERT": Aborting with CTRL-C don't remove the source.
 - Composed discs: New and correct calculation of total size and time stamps.
   For time stamps the newest times of all scanned files are used.
 - wit INFO FILE-FORMAT: New attribute 'compr': Signals a compressed file
   format and that option --compr can be used to setup the compression mode.
 - Splitted are also detected, if the field width of the counters is 2-6.

wit v1.21a r1980 - 2010-11-17

 - Simplification of the selection of compression modes:
    - Option --compr accepts the single digit modes '0' (=NONE), '1' (=fast
      LZMA) .. '9'@ (=BEST, best LZMA).
    - Option --wia accepts an optional parameter: --wia=mode
      This is a shortcut for: --wia --compression mode
   Example: Use --wia=9 to force WIA output with compression 9=BEST.
 - wit+wwt COMPR: Layout restyled.
 - wit DUMP: Additional scrubbed size info and tabbing changes.
 - Update to Cygwin DLL release version 1.7.7-1.
 - The verbose level and log output of "wit DIFF" is now like "wit COPY".
 - New option: wit COPY --diff: Diff source and dest after copying.
 - wit COPY: If copying without modifying content option --preserve is set
   automatically.
 - Detect and dump cert.bin files.
 - Detection and status of fake signing improved. Try "wit DUMP".
 - wit DUMP image --show cert: Print ceritificate chain.
 - If dumping a ticket a tmd file, the source directory is searched for a file
   named 'cert.bin' to check the signature.

wit v1.22a r2012 - 2010-11-22

 - New command: wit CERT: Collect certificates and eliminate multiple entries
   of the same certificate. Dump all collected certificates to standard
   output (stdout) and/or write the certificate as binary to a file. Together
   with the new option "--fake-sign filter" is is possible to fake sign some
   or all certificates before dumping and/or storing.
 - New global option: --cert: Add certificates to the global certificate
   database. These certificates are used to check the signatures.
 - "wit dump ticket.bin tmd.bin" is now able to dump the certificate chain
   following the TICKET or TMD info. This combination is usual for 'cetk'
   and 'tmd.1234' files in WADs.
 - Workaround for Cygwin bug in /proc/partitions.
 - Bug fix for "wit CONVERT --wia" (Segmentation fault).
 - Bug fix for 'preserve time' if source is removed.
 - Command "wit LIST" supports now --progress while scanning files and dirs.
 - The old tools 'wdf-cat' and 'wdf-dump' are removed. Use instead the new
   tool 'wdf'. 'wdf' is linked to 'wdf-cat' and 'wdf-dump' to facilitate the
   old behavior when calling 'wdf-cat' or 'wdf-dump'.

wit v1.23a r2092 - 2010-12-10

 - Preallocation of disc space implemented. It is only enabled for Cygwin by
   default. It can be disabled with --prealloc=0 or enabled with --prealloc.
   The needed preallocation function is not available for mac.
 - wwt EXTRACT + REMOVE + TOUCH + VERIFY:
   These commands accept now ID6 pattern like '...P' or '+1'. Each '.' is a
   wildcard that matches any single character. A '+' matches any number of
   characters. For details see http://wit.wiimm.de/info/disc-id.html
 - wwt EXTRACT is now able to patch while extracting and to create WIA files.
   It support also the options --fst --pmode --psel --raw --files and --sneek.
 - Cygwin will support UTF-8 by default.
 - Bug fix: Error while scanning LC_CTYPE for language detection.
 - Support of environment variable 'WWT_LANG' removed. Use 'WIT_LANG' instead.
 - "wit EDIT" supports now the options --psel and --raw.
 - Option --pmode accepts now the keywords AUTO, NONE, POINT, ID, NAME, INDEX
   and COMBI. Mode 'AUTO' switches to 'COMBI' if there are multiple partitions
   with the same partition type.

wit v1.23b r2096 - 2010-12-12

 - The progress counter is updated more frequently while creating a WIA file.
 - Bug fix for options --one-job and --job-limit.

wit v1.24a r2114 - 2010-12-23

 - "wwt ADD+EXTRACT" support now --one-job and --job-limit=n
 - Preallocation is now enabled by default for all systems without known
   disadvantages. Preallocation is also used for extrated files. Thanx to
   deo at gbatemp who shows me Linux and Mac optimizations.
 - wit+wwt VERIFY: Print signing and encryption status.
 - Bug fix: "wit FILES+DUMP" print the file size again.

wit v1.25a r2133 - 2011-01-09

 - Bug fix for "wit mix": If reading from FST signing failed.
 - Bug fix: The space preallocation for splitted files exceeded the defined
   limit. This results in an error on FAT partitions.
 - "wit DUMP image": IDs (ticket, tmd, boot) and IOS of the data partition are
   printed in the "intro" and "partition info" sections of the dump. Therefor
   the option --show has 3 new keywords: D-ID, P-ID and ID (=D-ID|P-ID).
   These new keywords can be used to minimze the dump (print IDs only).
 - wwt format: If formatting a device and option --hss is not, then the real
   sector size of the device is used. This is a concession for the new drives
   with 4096 instead of 512 bytes per block.

wit v1.25b r2143 - 2011-01-10

 - Bug fix for "wwt init": Auto hd sector size (hss) detection was wrong and
   returns always the value 4096.
 - "wwt FIND" supports option --sections and --old-style. The later one will
   ensure that the GUIs can read and scan the old style because I will change
   the layout completly in one of the next releases.

wit v1.26a r2223 - 2011-01-27

 - Bug fix for "wwt EXTRACT --test": If extracting to an already existing file
   the old file was removed.
 - Bug fix for "wdf +PACK": wrong data written if packing a raw file.
 - Bug fix: Reading a GameCube WIA is now done without an assertion failure.
   But remember: GameCube support is still EXPERIMENTAL!
 - I have made some changes in the make system to support GCC option -static
   and cross compiling (Linux/i386 on Linux/x86_64).
 - Linux/i386: Because of the static linking I can use the latest version of
   the Linux GLIBC with preallocation support. Copying file is now fast again.
 - BZIP2 support is now included as source and should work for all systems.
   This enables WIA/bzip2 support for Mac/x86_64.
 - "wit COPY/CONVERT/EXTRACT/EDIT/MOVE/DIFF" and "wwt ADD/EXTRACT/REMOVE"
   support now the option --sections.
 - "wwt add": New user interface implemented: In a first fast loop the jobs are
   counted with respect to the options like --update and --newer (ignore skiped
   files). In a second loop the jobs are executed with correct job counters.
 - wit DUMP: Scrubbing status of disc and partitions are printed. Example:
      "TICKET & TMD are well signed. Partition is encrypted and scrubbed."
 - "wit EXTRACT" failed if the disc title could not found in the title db.
 - New commands: "wit/wwt SKELETON": Create skeleton copies of discs for
   further analysis. Details: http://wit.wiimm.de/cmd/wit/skeleton#desc

wit v1.27a r2289 - 2011-02-09

 - Bug fix: WBFS preallocation was always a little bit to short.
 - Bug fix: Wrong signature status printed when dumping the content of TICKET
   and TMD files.
 - Bug fix: "wwt sync --newer FST" failed because of missing timestamp.
 - New option --links: Detect soft and hard linked source files while composing
   or extracting discs and try to create hard links instead of independent
