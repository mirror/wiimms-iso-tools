wit v2.00a r2834 - 2011-07-08

 - Because no bugs (exclude installing) reported since months my WIT tools
   seems to be perfect (or ready to use or something between). So it's time
   to increase the major version and to proclaim v2.00a. The whole project
   consists about 100 000 code lines.
 - Bug fix for Windows install script: Remove duplicate WIT entries.


wit v2.00b r2855 - 2011-07-13
 - Bug fix: If creating a Wii image and using hard links (option --links) the
   offsets of some hard linked files are wrong for some special situations.


wit v2.01a r3138 - 2011-10-27

 - Windows version only: Update to Cygwin DLL 1.7.9-1
 - Bug fix (thanx to fig2k4): Special characters in FST file names with code
   >127 will now be translated into UTF-8 to list and create files correct.
 - New option for "wwt LIST": --fragments: Print fragments and a ratio instead
   of the region info. A summary line is printed too.
 - New command: wwt LIST-F|LF: Short cut for "wwt LIST --fragments"
 - Option --sort=fragments sort some listings by the number of wbfs fragments.
 - Option --fast is ignored and will be removed in the near future.
   Please don't use --fast any longer.
 - New option: --copy-gc: If extracting a GameCube disc image, don't extract
   the real files to '/files/...'. Instead create a copy of the source image
   and store it as 'game.iso'. If the source image have the correct format and
   option --no-link is not set, try a hard link first.
 - Option --neek replaces the old --sneek, but --sneek is also accepted.
   Option --neek includes now option --copy-gc.
 - "wit extract --neek --dest %i": Extract like DiscEx (but faster!).
   The only change is for GameCube discs because of implied --copy-gc.


wit v2.02a r3240 - 2011-11-25

 - The default output filename for WBFS files changed from "ID6.wbfs" ("%+")
   to "TITLE [ID6].wbfs" ("%X").
 - The file order for composed files is now Nintendo like.
 - If extracting an image, a new files called 'align-files.txt' is created. It
   stores information about file alligning. If creating a new image and option
   --align-files is set, this file is read to align files, that have a previous
   aligning of >=0x8000 (Wii sector size). This fixes the bug for "Super Paper
   Mario" and perhaps for some other games.
 - wit FILES: If the file list is sorted by offset, than an 'unused' column is
   added before the 'offset' column.
 - wfuse for Mac is back again. It was lost because non installed FUSE package.


wit v2.03a r3309 - 2011-12-30

 - wit+wwt SKELETON: Support of GameCube images.
 - New command: wwt DUP: Duplicate an existing WBFS to a new file including
   block assigning errors. The idea is to have a command, that can duplicate
   a defect WBFS for tests.
 - Command "wwt DUMP" accept now --show for a fine control of printed data.
   The dump may now contain also a usage table and a integrity check report.

 - For a long time the code contains a WBFS extension. Now I have ompleted,
   enabled and tested it. With this extension the WBFS "free blocks table" is
   managed in a total different way:
    - WBFS access: While opening a WBFS the free blocks table is ignored.
      Instead of using the stored one an internal memory map of used blocks is
      built. This needs only a part of a second. Some advantages:
       - Errors in the free blocks table are irrelevant.
       - Blocks overlaps and invalid block assignings are automatically
         detected, reported, and fixed for internal usage.
       - If removing a discs with overlaps, the blocks are still marked used.
       - Blocks, that are not handled by the free blocks tables (the table is
         sometiems to small -> a result of a calculation bug in the original
         libwbfs) can be used. If closing, a new and fixed free blocks table
         will be written. This makes the whole process compatible to other
         WBFS managers and USB loaders.
    - wwt ADD: Before adding a disc its size is compared against the free size
      of the WBFS. This allows an early "disc full" error message.
    - wwt ADD: If adding a disc to a partition a continuous memory block is
      searched to minimize the (non existent) fragmentation. This disabled for
      WBFS files by default because a file itself can be fragmented. 
    - wwt ADD+PHANTOM --wbfs-alloc=mode: Set the WBFS block allocation mode.
    - The commands "wwt CHECK", "wwt REPAIR" and "wwt EDIT" have been modified
      to work with the new interface.


wit v2.04a r3554 - 2012-03-10

 - New option: wit --force: Ignore partition size errors and allow access to
   damaged partitions. "wwt --force" works similar.
 - New options: --disc-id=id, --boot-id=id, --ticket-id=id, --tmd-id=id and
   --wbfs-id=id: Patch only the specific ID. These options are handled after
   the --id and --modify options. Patching the WBFS ID while adding a game is
   now also possible.
 - New implementation of command "wit ID6": It generates an ID6 list of all
   sources. This is similar as before, only the meaning of the parameters
   changed. If option --long is set, a table with 5 IDs (DISC, BOOT, TICKET,
   TMD and WBFS) is printed. BOOT, TICKET and TMD IDs are taken from the main
   partition. If --long is set twice, all IDs of all partitions are printed.
 - wwt LLLL: List contains date and time (in seconds) columns.

Road map (for some point in the future):

 I have already stopped the development in favor of my SZS tools. But there
 are some already planned extensions:

 - GameCube support is still incomplete.
    - Creation of GameCube disc is not possible.

 - There are already code fragments implemented to trim discs in three levels:
    - Move partitions as whole to eliminate disc holes.
    - Move partition sectors to reduce partition size (alternative for
      partition scrubbing). Fake signing is necessary.
    - Move files of partitons to optimize the step above a little.
   For all trimming levels alignment factors may be set and it should be
   possible to set special alignments for GameCube sound files.

 - On the fly patching: Create a new image as combination of 2 or more sources.
   Therefor trimming (sector or file level) is needed.
