wit v2.00a r2834 - 2011-07-08

 - Because no bugs (exclude installing) reported since months my WIT tools
   seems to be perfect (or ready to use or something between). So it's time
   to increase the major version and to proclaim v2.00a. The whole project
   consists about 100 000 code lines.
 - Bug fix for Windows install script: Remove duplicate WIT entries.


wit v2.00b r2855 - 2011-07-13
 - Bug fix: If creating a Wii image and using hard links (option --links) the
   offsets of some hard linked files are wrong for some special situations.


wit v2.01a r3138 - 2011-10-27

 - Windows version only: Update to Cygwin DLL 1.7.9-1
 - Bug fix (thanx to fig2k4): Special characters in FST file names with code
   >127 will now be translated into UTF-8 to list and create files correct.
 - New option for "wwt LIST": --fragments: Print fragments and a ratio instead
   of the region info. A summary line is printed too.
 - New command: wwt LIST-F|LF: Short cut for "wwt LIST --fragments"
 - Option --sort=fragments sort some listings by the number of wbfs fragments.
 - Option --fast is ignored and will be removed in the near future.
   Please don't use --fast any longer.
 - New option: --copy-gc: If extracting a GameCube disc image, don't extract
   the real files to '/files/...'. Instead create a copy of the source image
   and store it as 'game.iso'. If the source image have the correct format and
   option --no-link is not set, try a hard link first.
 - Option --neek replaces the old --sneek, but --sneek is also accepted.
   Option --neek includes now option --copy-gc.
 - "wit extract --neek --dest %i": Extract like DiscEx (but faster!).
   The only change is for GameCube discs because of implied --copy-gc.


wit v2.02a r3240 - 2011-11-25

 - The default output filename for WBFS files changed from "ID6.wbfs" ("%+")
   to "TITLE [ID6].wbfs" ("%X").
 - The file order for composed files is now Nintendo like.
 - If extracting an image, a new files called 'align-files.txt' is created. It
   stores information about file alligning. If creating a new image and option
   --align-files is set, this file is read to align files, that have a previous
   aligning of >=0x8000 (Wii sector size). This fixes the bug for "Super Paper
   Mario" and perhaps for some other games.
 - wit FILES: If the file list is sorted by offset, than an 'unused' column is
   added before the 'offset' column.
 - wfuse for Mac is back again. It was lost because non installed FUSE package.


Road map (for some point in the future):

 I have already stopped the development in favor of my SZS tools. But there
 are some already planned extensions:

 - GameCube support is still incomplete.
    - Creation of GameCube disc is not possible.

 - There are already code fragments implemented to trim discs in three levels:
    - Move partitions as whole to eliminate disc holes.
    - Move partition sectors to reduce partition size (alternative for
      partition scrubbing). Fake signing is necessary.
    - Move files of partitons to optimize the step above a little.
   For all trimming levels alignment factors may be set and it should be
   possible to set special alignments for GameCube sound files.

 - On the fly patching: Create a new image as combination of 2 or more sources.
   Therefor trimming (sector or file level) is needed.
