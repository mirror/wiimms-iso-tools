*******************************************************************************

Some wit commands (DUMP, ILIST, EXTRACT) will operate with the files contained
by ISO images. The option --files=rule_list defines which files are processed.

Option syntax:
	-F      rule_list
	--files rule_list
	--files=rule_list
	    

'rule_list' is a semicolon separated list of rules. Each rules begin with a
plus sign fpr a allow rule or a minus sign for a deny rule. The options can
be used multiple times to define more and more rules.

Rule Syntax:
	rule_list  := rule [ ';' rule_list ]
	rule       := skip_rule | std_rule | macro_call
	skip_rule  := number prefix pattern
	std_rule   := prefix pattern
	macro_call := '=' pattern
	prefix     := '+' | '-'
	pattern    := [char]...
	number     := '1'..'9' ['0'..'9']...

'pattern' is a file pattern including wildcards. The design is like 'rsync'.

The rule patterns are compared with the source path inside the ISO. A source
path looks like "DIRECTORY/FILE.EXT" without the partition prefix (example:
sys/boot.bin). The '/' at the beginning of the pattern is like a '^' in regular
expressions. If the pattern starts with a '/' then it is matched against the
beginning of the source path. Otherwise it is matched against the end of the
source path. To force matching against the end use a '$' as last character in
the pattern.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a short description of the special characters:

   /  : At the beginning of pattern
         => Match against the beginning of the source path

   $  : At the end of pattern => 
         => Match against the end of the source path. This is the default if
            no '/' is at the beginning or the end of the pattern.

   *  : Match any number (zero or more) of characters but not '/'.

   ** : Match any number (zero or more) of characters including  '/'.
   
   #  : Match any number (one or more) of digit ('0'..'9').

   ?  : match exact 1 character but not '/'.

  ' ' : (SPACE) Match space and any controll charaters (ASCII 1..32).

 [..] : Match 1 character of the list within the brackets. The list is
        analyzed in the following way:
         - If the first character is a '^' then characters not in the
           list are matched.
         - If the next character (behind optional '^') is a '+' or a '*'
           then it is matched against the maximum possible characters.
           A '+' means that at least one character must match.
         - The list contains single characters 'c' or ranges 'x-y'.
           To use a ']' it must be the first character. To use a '-' it
           must be the first or last character.

 {..} : This is a comma separated list of alternatives. It matches if
        at least one alternative match. {..} can be used recursivley.

   \c : Any character preseded by '\' looses its special meaning and
        is handled as normal character.


Pattern examples:

      .wad : all files ending with '.wad'

      */   : all directories but no files

    dir/   : all directories which name ends with 'dir'.

    dir/*  : all files in directories which name ends with 'dir'.

    dir/** : all files in (sub-)directories which name ends with 'dir'.

 **/dir/** : all files in (sub-)directories which name is 'dir'.

 /dir/
 /dir/*
 /dir/**   : All files in the first level directory 'dir'
             including subdiretories.

 /dir/*$   : All files in in the first level directory 'dir'
             excluding subdiretories.

 /dir/*.wad
           : All '*.wad' files in the first level directory 'dir' excluding
             subdiretories and all files in diretories named *.wad.
             
 /DATA/dir/**.wad
           : All '*.wad' files in in the first level directory 'dir'
             including subdiretories.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Processing the Rule list:

Each option --filter= define a list of rules. Each file is checked agains the
every rule on the list until a pattern matches the file name. If the rule
match the file name the rule prefix decide what to do. A '+' means include
the file and a '-' means exclude the file. A '=' calls an internal macro to
define a set of rules.

If a '+' or '-' is preceded by a decimal numeber the rule has a special
meaning. If '+' and the pattern does match then the following NUMBER rules are
skipped. If '-' and the pattern does not match then the following NUMBER rules
are skipped. 

If no rule match the prefix, the last rule in the list decide what to do.
If the last rule is a '+' rule than the file is excluded (opposite handling).
If the last rule is a '-' rule than the file is included.

A empty list means: include all files.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule macros:

Rule macros are predifined rules to make live easier. Some of them exists
as positive (without prefix 'no') and as negative (with prefix 'no') rule.

 =base		:= +/*$
 =nobase	:= -/*$

    Allow or deny files of the base directory
    (ticket.bin, tmd.bin, cert.bin, h3.bin),


 =disc		:= +/disc/
 =nodisc	:= -/disc/

    Allow or deny files from the 'disc' directory.
    (disc/header.bin, disc/region.bin)


 =sys		:= +/sys/
 =nosys		:= -/sys/

    Allow or deny files from the 'sys' directory.
    (sys/boot.bin, sys/bi2.bin, sys/apploader.img, sys/main.dol, sys/fst.bin)


 =files		:= +/files/
 =nofiles	:= -/files/

    Allow or deny files from the 'file' directory.
    This are the real files of the ISO image.


 =wit		:= 2+/h3.bin ; 1+/sys/fst.bin ; +
 =wwt		:= =wit

    Allow files that are used from wit and wwt to compose an ISO image.


 =sneek		:= 2+/h3.bin ; 1+/disc/ ; +

    Allow files that SNEEK needs.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Examples:

  --filter +
	include all files

  --filter -
	exclude all files

  --filter +.wad
	include all '*.wad' files

  --filter -.wad
	exclude all '*.wad' files

  --filter '+.wad;-d'
	exclude all '*d' files but not '*.wad'

  --filter '+.h3.bin;=sneek'
	suppress for SNEEK unneded files, but add 'h3.bin'.
