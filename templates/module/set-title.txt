 Processing the new title:

    The title string is parsed for escape sequences beginning with the escape
    character '%'. The accepted format is:

        '%cX'  or  '%mcX'  or  '%n-mcX'

    'n' is the number of skipped characters of the field.

    'm' is the zero based index of the last copied character.

    'c' is an optional character. If c is 'u' then the source will be
        converted to uppercase and if c is 'l' to lower case.

    'X' selects the source and is one of:

        'i' : the (new) ID6
        'I' : the (new) ID6
        'j' : The previous ID stored in the WBFS inode.
        'J' : The previous ID stored in the ISO header.

        'n' : The previous disc title stored in the WBFS inode.
        'N' : The previous disc title stored in the ISO ehader.

        't' : The title from the title database based on the new ID or, if not
              changed, on the ID of the WBFS inode. If no title found the disc
              name stored in the WBFS inode is used.
        'T' : Same as 't'
        'p' : The title from the title database based on the previous ID stored
              in the WBFS inode. If no title found the disc name stored in the
              WBFS inode is used.
        'P' : The title from the title database based on the previous ID stored
              in the ISO header. If no title found the disc name stored in the
              ISO header is used.

        If the object to change is not a WBFS then the ISO data is used instead
        of the WBFS inode data ('j', 'n', and 'p' conversions).

    To use the '%' sign itself just type '%%'.

    Instead of '%' an alternative escape character can be used. It is defined
    by the option --esc. This makes live easier if using the cygwin version
    together with the windows shell 'cmd'. Define the environment variables
    'WIT_OPT' and/or 'WWT_OPT' for a new default definition.
