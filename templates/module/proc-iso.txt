Commands like "wwt ADD" or "wit COPY" uses ISO files as input. They accept
plain ISO files and ISO files in WDF, CISO and WBFS containers and FST
directories. In detail:

 /path/to/PLAIN_ISO:
    A PLAIN ISO file is a 1:1 copy of a Wii disc, may be scrubbed. It is not
    compressed and not part of any container. The standard extension is ".iso".

 /path/to/WDF_ISO:
    This is an ISO packed in a WDF container. WDF container may be used for
    any files and not only for ISO images. The standard extension is ".wdf".

 /path/to/CISO:
    This is an ISO packed in a CISO container. CISO container may be used for
    any files and not only for ISO images. The standard extensions are
    ".ciso" (default) and ".wbi".

 /path/to/WBFS_FILE
    An WBFS file/device is also accepted like a list of ISO files. The standard
    extension for WBFS files is ".wbfs".

 /path/to/WBFS_FILE/SELECTOR
    This is a special construct. The ISO image of the WBFS_FILE selected
    by SELECTOR is used as source. The selector may be one of:

     - 'ABCDEF' : ID6 of a disc (exact 6 characters)

     - index    : The zero based index of the disc. The range goes from zero
                  up to the number of discs in the WBFS minus 1.
                  (decimal number, but not 6 digits)

     - '#' slot : The decimal slot number within the WBFS. The range goes from
                  zero up to the maximal number of possible discs in the WBFS
                  minus 1.

    Examples:
      .../a.wbfs/rmcp01 : use "Mario Kart" from 'a.wbfs' as source.
      .../a.wbfs/5      : use the image with index #5 from 'a.wbfs' as source.
      .../a.wbfs/#5     : use the image at slot #5 from 'a.wbfs' as source.

 /path/do/FST_directory
    If the path is a directory and the directory contains a valid FST (File
    SysTem) structure then the directory structure is used to build an internal
    virtual ISO image. Most commands can use this virtual ISO image like a
    real image.


When writing ISO files the option --wdf, --iso, --ciso, --wbfs and --fst
control the output format. If writing a WBFS file this WBFS is truncated and
contains exactly one ISO image. The default file name of this WBFS is
'<ID6>.wbfs'. If none of --wdf, --iso, --ciso, --wbfs or --fst is set, the
destination filename will be analyzed. If the extension (ignoring case) is
".wdf", ".iso", ".ciso", ".wbi" (an alternative for ".ciso") or ".wbfs",
the specific output format is used. The default is WDF if all other fails.
