 - Support of GameCube multiboot discs. (EXPERIMENTAL!)

Known bugs:

 - There are new problems while reading from non seekable sources (e.g. pipes).
   The reason is the complete new and more intelligent wiidisc lib which makes
   more lookups. I have to insert some code especially for pipes. My plans
   that copying multiple partition discs works too.
   ==> The best is to use a version 1.01c for pipes.
 - No bzip2 (WIA) support for MAC/x86_64. (bug in the bzip2 library)

Missing docu:

 - wit commands FILES + EXTRACT + EDIT => see built in help
 - Option --show => see built in help
