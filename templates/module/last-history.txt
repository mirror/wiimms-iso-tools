 - New command: wit CERT: Collect certificates and eliminate multiple entires
   of the same certificate. Dump all collected certificates to standard
   output (stdout) or write the certificate as binary to a file.
 - New global option: --cert: Add certificates to the global certificate
   database. These certificates are used to check the signatures.
 - "wit dump ticket.bin tmd.bin" is now able to dump the cetificate chain
   following the TICKET or TMD info. This combination is usal for 'cetk'
   and 'tmd.1234' files in WADs.


Known bugs:

 - The GameCube support is in development and EXPERIMENTAL!
 - wit COPY --raw: Copying an image in raw mode to a WBFS file is buggy.
 - There are new problems while reading from non seekable sources (e.g. pipes).
   The reason is the complete new and more intelligent wiidisc lib which makes
   more lookups ==> The best is to use version 1.01c for pipes.
 - No bzip2 (WIA) support for MAC/x86_64. (bug in the bzip2 library)
