 - The default output filename for WBFS files changed from "ID6.wbfs" ("%+")
   to "TITLE [ID6].wbfs" ("%X").
 - The file order for composed files is now Nintendo like.
 - If extracting an image, a new files called 'align-files.txt' is created. It
   stores information about file alligning. If creating a new image and option
   --align-files is set, this file is read to align files, that have a previous
   aligning of >=0x8000 (Wii sector size). This fixes the bug for "Super Paper
   Mario" and perhaps for some other games.
 - wit FILES: If the file list is sorted by offset, than an 'unused' column is
   added before the 'offset' column.
 - wfuse for Mac is back again. It was lost because non installed FUSE package.


Known bugs:

 - There are new problems while reading from non seekable sources (e.g. pipes).
   The reason is the complete new and more intelligent wiidisc lib which makes
   more lookups ==> The best is to use version 1.01c for pipes.
