   disc) of the related source image to the destination image. Patching with
   the options --id and --name is possible.
 - New "wit MIX" qualifer: REGION: Copy the region infor (32 Bytes at offset
   0x4e000) of the related source image to the destination image. Patching
   with the option --region is possible.
 - Bug fix: "wit mix --name discname" didn't work.

wit v1.15a.beta2 r1534 - 2010-08-12

 - Writing a WBFS file is now part of the file layer and libwbfs is only used
   as helper. Now every command, and also "wit MIX", is able to write to a
   WBFS file like to any other formats.
 - "INSTALLER" is now an alternative name for the "UPDATE" partition, like
   "GAME" for "DATA" since the epoch.
 - To manage allowed and permitted options, 64 bit integer numbers had been
   used. Now arrays will be used, because wwt have already reached the limit
   of 64 command specific options. Hope that all works like before.

 - Bug fix for "wit mix --overlay".

Known bugs:

 - There are new problems while reading from non seekable sources (e.g. pipes).
   The reason is the complete new and more intelligent wiidisc lib which makes
   more lookups. I have to insert some code especially for pipes. My plans
   that copying multiple partition discs works too.
   ==> The best is to use a version 1.01c for pipes.
