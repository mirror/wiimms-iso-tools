wit v1.13a r1468 - 2010-08-04

 - Command "wit MIX" accepts now the option --overlay: Partitions will
   be overlayed so that data from one partition is stored in unused areas
   of a other partition. To find the optimum order a permutation is done.
   Option --overlay limits the number of input partitions to 12, because
   the calculation is rated as O(2^n).  *** "wit MIX" is EXPERIMENTAL! ***
 - "wit MIX" wil accept the keyword 'psel' as alternative to 'select'.
   The reason is that 'select' accepts the same keyword list as --psel.
 - The disc subsystems recognize overlayes partitons. For overlayed
   partitions the --psel keyword "WHOLE" is ignored.
 - Command "wit DUMP" will print an info line for overlayed partitions.

 - New option --rm-files: This patching option defines filter rules to remove
   real files and directories from the FST of the DATA partition. Fake signing
   of the TMD is necessary.
 - New option --zero-files: This patching option defines filter rules to zero
   (set size to zero) real files of the FST of the DATA partition. Fake
   signing$ of the TMD is necessary.
 - New option --ignore-files: This option defines filter rules to ignore
   system and real directories and files of the FST of the DATA partition.
   Fake signing is not necessary, but the partition becomes invalid, because
   the content of some files is not copied.
 - New qualifier for "wit MIX": "IGNORE ruleset": Ignore files when copying a
   disc image. See http://wit.wiimm.de/wit/cmd-mix.html#ignore for details.

Known bugs:

 - There are new problems while reading from non seekable sources (e.g. pipes).
   The reason is the complete new and more intelligent wiidisc lib which makes
   more lookups. I have to insert some code especially for pipes. My plans
   that copying multiple partition discs works too.
   ==> The best is to use a version 1.01c for pipes.
