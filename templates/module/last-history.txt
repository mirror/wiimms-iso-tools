wit v1.17a.beta3 r1724 - 2010-09-12

 - The new tool 'wdf' should replace the tools wdf-cat, wdf-dump and should
   compensate the old tools wdf2iso and iso2wdf as general wdf converters.
   See built in help for details. The tool 'wdf' is EXPERIMENTAL!
 - Support of GameCube multiboot discs. (EXPERIMENTAL!)
 - New options --align-part: Align partitions while moving or creating them.
 - New options --disc-size: Define a minimal disc size.
 - Command "wit SCRUB" renamed to "wit CONVERT". "wit SCRUB" is still allowed.
 - From now the first 0x50000 bytes of Wii discs will be scanned for non zero
   data. Such data is included into the copy operations. The old and standard
   scrubbing algorithm ignore such sectors in the range 0x08000..0x3ffff.
 - The WIA file format was completely redesigned and a new beta test phase is
   starting. Please see WIA still as EXPERIMENTAL!

 - Bug fix: While composing the FST size (var 'max_fst_size4' in 'boot.bin')
   wasn't updated. If you compose an ISO and the resulting FST is bigger than
   the original, the Wii apploader failed.
 - Bug fix: Creation of a WIA file failed if option --psel is set and at least
   one partition was removed (scrubbed). The result was an invalid disc image.
 - Buf fix: "wit MOVE" didn't create the directory path even if --DEST is set.
 - WIA supports now 5 compression methods: NONE, PURGE, BZIP2, LZMA and LZMA2.
   There are 3 additional keywords: FASTEST (=PURGE), BEST and DEFAULT (=LZMA).
 - New command: WIT COMPR: Prints a list with supported compression methods.
   With parameters the normalized names of that parameters are printed.
   WIT COMPR accepts the options --long (twice) --no-header and --sections.

~ - I declare the WIA file format stable and hope that converting to and from
~   WIA is free of bugs. The best for users is to convert to WIA and back and
~   compare the result with the original source. If creating a WIA file in raw
~   mode data between partitions and behind the last partition is not copied.

Known bugs:

 - wit COPY --raw: Copying a image in raw mode to a wbfs file is buggy.
 - There are new problems while reading from non seekable sources (e.g. pipes).
   The reason is the complete new and more intelligent wiidisc lib which makes
   more lookups. I have to insert some code especially for pipes. My plans
   that copying multiple partition discs works too.
   ==> The best is to use a version 1.01c for pipes.
 - No bzip2 (WIA) support for MAC/x86_64. (bug in the bzip2 library)
