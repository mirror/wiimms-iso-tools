wit v@@VERSION@@ r@@REV-NEXT@@ - @@@@-@@-@@

 - After 4 years development this version should be the last release of the
   WIT-Tools until further notice; with exception of bug fix releases. I will
   discontinue adding new features. That's the reason for the little version
   jump to v2.20a.
 - New command: "wwt NEW" is a short cut for "wwt ADD --update --newer".
 - Cygwin (Windows) DDLs updated.
 - Title data base updated.
