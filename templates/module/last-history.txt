 - Bug fix for option --sneek: Option --psel was not set in a correct way.
 - New command: wit CREATE TICKET/TMD: Create a ticket or tmd file from
   scratch. Options and parameters control the creation.
 - Composing: If files ticket.bin or tmd.bin missed or have a wrong size
   TICKET and/or TMD will be created automatically.

Known bugs:
 - There a new problems while reading from non ssekable sources (e.g. pipes).
   The reason is the complete new and more intelligent wiidisc lib. I have
   to insert some code especially for pipes. My plans that copying multiple
   partition discs works too.

The best is to use a version <1.10 for pipes.

Missing docu:

 - wit commands ILIST + EXTRACT + EDIT
 - Option --show => see built in help
