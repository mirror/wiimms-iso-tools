 - Script 'load-titles.sh' will be copied on install into the share folder to
   allow later and easy update of the title database.
 - New command: wit+wwt GETTITLES: Change to the share folder an call script
   'load-titles.sh' to update the title database.

Known bugs:

 - The GameCube support is in development and EXPERIMENTAL!
 - There are new problems while reading from non seekable sources (e.g. pipes).
   The reason is the complete new and more intelligent wiidisc lib which makes
   more lookups ==> The best is to use version 1.01c for pipes.
