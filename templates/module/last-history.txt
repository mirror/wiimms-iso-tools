 - Bug fix for "wit mix": If reading from FST signing failed.
 - Bug fix: The space preallocation for splitted files exceeded the defined
   limit. This results in an error on FAT partitions.
 - "wit DUMP image": IDs (ticket, tmd, boot) and IOS of the data partition are
   printed in the "intro" and "partition info" sections of the dump. Therefor
   the option --show has 3 new keywords: D-ID, P-ID and ID (=D-ID|P-ID).
   These new keywords can be used to minimze the dump (print IDs only).
 - wwt format: If formatting a device and option --hss is not, then the real
   sector size of the device is used. This is a concession for the new drives
   with 4096 instead of 512 bytes per block.


Known bugs:

 - The GameCube support is in development and EXPERIMENTAL!
    - Conversion to WIA fails.
 - wit COPY --raw: Copying an image in raw mode to a WBFS file is buggy.
 - There are new problems while reading from non seekable sources (e.g. pipes).
   The reason is the complete new and more intelligent wiidisc lib which makes
   more lookups ==> The best is to use version 1.01c for pipes.
 - No WIA/bzip2 support for MAC/x86_64. (bug in the Mac bzip2 library)
