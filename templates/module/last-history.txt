 - New option --links: Detect soft and hard linked source files while composing
   or extracting discs and try to create hard links instead of independent
   copies on the destination file system.


Known bugs:

 - The GameCube support is in development and EXPERIMENTAL!
 - There are new problems while reading from non seekable sources (e.g. pipes).
   The reason is the complete new and more intelligent wiidisc lib which makes
   more lookups ==> The best is to use version 1.01c for pipes.
