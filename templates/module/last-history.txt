Aggregation of the previous beta versions:

 - New option: --width wd: Define the width (number of columns) for help and
   other messages and disables the automatic detection of the terminal width.
 - I have rewritten the wiidisc lib (part of libwbfs) from scratch. It has a
   complete new interface and an improved functionality. It uses dynamic data
   structures and collect data as needed. This has considerable advantages
   for the whole WIT project.
 - ID renaming: A point ('.') means: leave id character unchanged.
 - Options --ios, --id and --name modify only disc data and the DATA partition,
   but no longer other any other partitions.
 - There is an complete new implementation of option --psel: Combinations like
   '--psel DATA,UPDATE' or '--psel -CHANNEL' are supported now.
 - wwt EXTRACT: Complete new and improved calculation of output filename.
 - wwt EXTRACT: Support '%X' and '%Y' in output filenames.
 - Option --files: Macro calls are now prefixed by a colon (':'). The previous
   prefix '=' is obsolete, but still allowed.
 - Bug fix: File size calculation error for when composing large discs.
