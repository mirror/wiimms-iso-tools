 - "wwt ADD+EXTRACT" support now --one-job and --job-limit=n
 - Preallocation is now enabled by default for all systems without known
   disadvantages. Preallocation is also used for extrated files. Thanx to
   deo at gbatemp who shows me Linux and Mac optimizations.
 - wit+wwt VERIFY: Print signing and encryption status.
 - Bug fix: "wit FILES+DUMP" print the file size again.


Known bugs:

 - The GameCube support is in development and EXPERIMENTAL!
 - wit COPY --raw: Copying an image in raw mode to a WBFS file is buggy.
 - There are new problems while reading from non seekable sources (e.g. pipes).
   The reason is the complete new and more intelligent wiidisc lib which makes
   more lookups ==> The best is to use version 1.01c for pipes.
 - No WIA/bzip2 support for MAC/x86_64. (bug in the Mac bzip2 library)
