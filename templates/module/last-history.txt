wit v@@VERSION@@ r@@REV-NEXT@@ - @@@@-@@-@@

 - Preallocation of disc space implemented. It is only enabled for Cygwin by
   default. It can be disabled with --prealloc=0 or enabled with --prealloc.
   The needed preallocation function is not available for mac.
 - wwt EXTRACT + REMOVE + TOUCH + VERIFY:
   These commands accept now ID6 pattern like '...P' or '+1'. Each '.' is a
   wildcard that matches any single character. A '+' matches any number of
   characters. For details see http://wit.wiimm.de/info/disc-id.html
 - wwt EXTRACT is now able to patch while extracting and to create WIA files.
   It support also the options --fst --pmode --psel --raw --files and --sneek.
 - Cygwin will support UTF-8 by default.
 - Bug fix: Error while scanning LC_CTYPE for language detection.
 - Support of environment variable 'WWT_LANG' removed. Use 'WIT_LANG' instead.
 - "wit EDIT" supports now the options --psel and --raw.
 - Option --pmode accepts now the keywords AUTO, NONE, POINT, ID, NAME, INDEX
   and COMBI. Mode 'AUTO' switches to 'COMBI' if there are multiple partitions
   with the same partition type.


Known bugs:

 - The GameCube support is in development and EXPERIMENTAL!
 - wit COPY --raw: Copying an image in raw mode to a WBFS file is buggy.
 - There are new problems while reading from non seekable sources (e.g. pipes).
   The reason is the complete new and more intelligent wiidisc lib which makes
   more lookups ==> The best is to use version 1.01c for pipes.
 - No WIA/bzip2 support for MAC/x86_64. (bug in the Mac bzip2 library)
