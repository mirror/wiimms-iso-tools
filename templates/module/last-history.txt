wit v1.14a.beta2 r1485 - 2010-08-06

 - New option --rm-files: This patching option defines filter rules to remove
   real files and directories from the FST of the DATA partition. Fake signing
   of the TMD is necessary.
 - New option --zero-files: This patching option defines filter rules to zero
   (set size to zero) real files of the FST of the DATA partition. Fake
   signing$ of the TMD is necessary.
 - New option --ignore-files: This option defines filter rules to ignore
   system and real directories and files of the FST of the DATA partition.
   Fake signing is not necessary, but the partition becomes invalid, because
   the content of some files is not copied.
 - New qualifier for "wit MIX": "IGNORE ruleset": Ignore files when copying a
   disc image. See http://wit.wiimm.de/wit/cmd-mix.html#ignore for details.

wit v1.14a.beta3 r1493 - 2010-08-07

 - Some modification for expanding '@file' parameters: wit MIX needs control.
 - Bug fix: "wit MIX ... ignore @file" works now.
 - Option --psel redesigned: it is now possible to allow or deny any partiton
   by partiton type, partiton table and/or by partiton index. Only with the
   unambiguous partiton index it is possible to select the one wanted DATA
   partition if multiple exists.

 - Bug fix for "wit mix .. select": Default was to select all partitons.
   Now the default is to select only DATA partition of partition table #0.
 - Bug fix for "wit MIX": The calculation of the largest hole was wrong.
 - wit MIX: A new algorithm for 2 partitions: It tries every possible shift to
   find the best overlay. All holes in both partitions are relevant.
 - wit MIX: Before creating the image a additional verify function is called.
   This function controls that no sector is used by more than one partition.
   With verbose level >= 3 a usage map is printed too.

Known bugs:

 - There are new problems while reading from non seekable sources (e.g. pipes).
   The reason is the complete new and more intelligent wiidisc lib which makes
   more lookups. I have to insert some code especially for pipes. My plans
   that copying multiple partition discs works too.
   ==> The best is to use a version 1.01c for pipes.
