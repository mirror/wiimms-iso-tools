 - New "wit MIX" qualifer: HEADER: Copy the disc header (first 256 bytes of
   disc) of the related source image to the destination image. Patching with
   the options --id and --name is possible.
 - New "wit MIX" qualifer: REGION: Copy the region infor (32 Bytes at offset
   0x4e000) of the related source image to the destination image. Patching
   with the option --region is possible.
 - Bug fix: "wit mix --name discname" didn't work.
 - Bug fix for "wit mix --overlay".
 - Writing a WBFS file is now part of the file layer and libwbfs is only used
   as helper. Now every command, and also "wit MIX", is able to write to a
   WBFS file like to any other formats without special code.
 - "INSTALLER" is now an alternative name for the "UPDATE" partition, like
   "GAME" for "DATA" since the epoch.
 - To manage allowed and permitted options, 64 bit integer numbers had been
   used. Now arrays will be used, because wwt have already reached the limit
   of 64 command specific options. Hope that all run as before.
 - Korean disc support implemented. (I can't test this by myself)
 - New option: --common-key index: Change the common key index of all partitions
   and fake sign the tickets.
 - I have implemented a new "ID selection interface". It works with positive
   ('+') and negative ('-' or '/') rules. A rule consist up to 6 characters,
   case is ignored. Points ('.') are wildcards for a single character and mult
   ('*') and plus ('+') for many characters. Each source ID6 is compared to
   each rule of the list until a rules matches the ID. If it is a positive rule,
   the ID is inserted into the workig list.
 - The syntax of the commands "wit ID6" and "wwt ID6" have changed to use the
   new "ID selection interface" (see above). More commands will follow.
 - The commands 'wit ILIST/ILIST-L/ILIST-LL' are renamed to 'wit FILES/FILES-L
   /FILES-LL'. The old command names are still allowed.
 - The new command "wit FDIFF" is a shortcut for "wit DIFF --files +".

Known bugs:

 - There are new problems while reading from non seekable sources (e.g. pipes).
   The reason is the complete new and more intelligent wiidisc lib which makes
   more lookups. I have to insert some code especially for pipes. My plans
   that copying multiple partition discs works too.
   ==> The best is to use a version 1.01c for pipes.
