wit v1.12a r1451 - 2010-08-01

 - Bug fix for option --sneek: Option --psel was not set in a correct way.
 - New command: wit CREATE TICKET/TMD: Create a ticket or tmd file from
   scratch. Options and parameters control the creation.
 - Composing: If files ticket.bin or tmd.bin missed or have a wrong size
   TICKET and/or TMD will be created automatically.
 - New command: wit MIX: Mix partitions from different sources into one
   new Wii disc image.  *** "wit MIX" is EXPERIMENTAL! ***

wit v@@VERSION@@ r@@REV-NEXT@@ - @@@@-@@-@@

 - Command "wit MIX" accepts now the option --overlay: Partitions will
   be overlayed so that data from one partition is stored in unused areas
   of a other partition. To find the optimum order a permutation is done.
   Option --overlay limits the number of input partitions to 12, because
   the calculation is rated as O(2^n).  *** "wit MIX" is EXPERIMENTAL! ***
 - "wit MIX" wil accept the keyword 'psel' as alternative to 'select'.
   The reason is that 'select' accepts the same keyword list as --psel.
 - The disc subsystems recognize overlayes partitons. For overlayed
   partitions the --psel keyword "WHOLE" is ignored.
 - Command "wit DUMP" will print an info line for overlayed partitions.

Known bugs:

 - There are new problems while reading from non seekable sources (e.g. pipes).
   The reason is the complete new and more intelligent wiidisc lib which makes
   more lookups. I have to insert some code especially for pipes. My plans
   that copying multiple partition discs works too.
   ==> The best is to use a version 1.01c for pipes.

 - wit commands ILIST + EXTRACT + EDIT + CREATE => see built in help
 - Option --show => see built in help
