 - Bug fix for GameCube extracts: The alignments in file 'align-files.txt'
   were too large by a factor of 4.
 - WDF version 2 is now the default WDF version. Use --wdf1 to force v1.
 - With v2.21a (June 2013) the default output file format was switched from
   WDF to WBFS. Since that command SKELETON used this new default by mistake.
   Now the much more efficient WDFv2 is used as default for skeletons.
 - Command SKELETON supports now GameCube images.
 - Windows only: Cygwin update to v1.7.32 2014-08-13.
