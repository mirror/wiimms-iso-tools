wit v1.10a.beta r1428 - 2010-07-24  (correct version should be "v1.11a.beta")

wit v1.11a r1434 - 2010-07-26

 - Option --region: endian bug fix

wit v@@VERSION@@ r@@REV-NEXT@@ - @@@@-@@-@@

 - Bug fix for option --sneek: Option --psel was not set in a correct way.
 - New command: wit CREATE TICKET/TMD: Create a ticket or tmd file from
   scratch. Options and parameters control the creation.
 - Composing: If files ticket.bin or tmd.bin missed or have a wrong size
   TICKET and/or TMD will be created automatically.
 - New command: wit MIX: Mix partitions from different sources into one
   new Wii disc image. "wit MIX" is EXPERIMENTAL!

Known bugs:
 - There a new problems while reading from non seekable sources (e.g. pipes).
   The reason is the complete new and more intelligent wiidisc lib which makes
   more lookups. I have to insert some code especially for pipes. My plans
   that copying multiple partition discs works too.
   ==> The best is to use a version <1.10 for pipes.

Missing docu:

 - wit commands ILIST + EXTRACT + EDIT
 - Option --show => see built in help
