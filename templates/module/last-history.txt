wit v@@VERSION@@ r@@REV-NEXT@@ - @@@@-@@-@@

 - This will be the last release of v2.* series. I plan to reorganize the code
   and to use my own C source library and to integrate Wii U support.
 - New command: wit ID8: Print ID6 + 2 next bytes as disc and version number.
 - Title database: Definitions without titles (e.g. "RMCP =") will remove the
   related title from the internal title database. If a ID is followed by a
   star (e.g. "RMC* ="), then all titles beginning with the ID are removed.
 - Title database updated.
 - Some minor text edits.
 - Windows only: Cygwin update to v2.6.1 2016-12-16.
