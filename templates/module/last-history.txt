wit v1.10a.beta r1333 - 2010-07-05

 - New option: --width wd: Define the width (number of columns) for help and
   other messages and disables the automatic detection of the terminal width.
 - wwt EXTRACT: Support '%X' and '%Y' in output filenames.
 - I have rewritten the wiidisc lib (part of libwmfs) from scratch. It has a
   complete new interface and an improved functionality. It uses dynamic data
   structures and collect data as needed. This has considerable advantages
   for the whole WIT project:
    - All information about a Wii disc is now in one hand. Things like usage
      maps and partition data are loaded/built once and only if needed.
    - wit DUMP --show=files: Print a list with images files (like -F+ before).
      Option --show=offset,size,dec,hex,header controls the output columns.
    - wit DUMP --show=usage: Print a wii sector usage map.
    - wit ILIST: Redesigned. Option --show=offset,size,dec,hex,header,path
      controls the output columns.
    - Option --psel extended:
        --psel=NO-ID : use all partitions but not partitions with an ID type.
        --psel=PTAB0 : use all partitions of table #0 but no other partitions.
        --psel=ALL   : use all partitions (the default).
        --psel=WHOLE : use all partitions and don't scrub partitions
        --psel=RAW   : more than 'WHOLE': copy whole dics
    - wit DIFF: If using the option --psel the partition tables are normalized
      before comparing. This enables DIFF to compare DATA partitions only
      independent from the existence of other partitions.

wit v1.10a.beta r1338 - 2010-07-05  (repos only)

 - Channels partitions enabled, but not tested.
 - The field width of offset and size columns of FST listings is now
   calculated. A space between the columns is guaranteed.
 - wit DUMP: A forgotten endian calculation results in a wrong region info.

wit v1.10a.beta r1359 - 2010-07-09

 - ID renaming: A point ('.') means: leave id character unchanged.
 - Options --ios, --id and --name modify only disc data and the DATA partition,
   but no longer other any other partitions.
 - There is an complete new implementation of option --psel: Combinations like
   '--psel DATA,UPDATE' or '--psel -CHANNEL' are supported now.
 - New: wit DUMP --show=patch: Shows a address map with patching infos.
 - wwt EXTRACT: Complete new and improved calculation of output filename.
 - Option --files: Macro calls are now prefixed by a colon (':'). The previous
   prefix '=' is obsolete, but still allowed.
 - Command "wit ILIST" evaluates option --psel now.
 - I have run my test scripts against this release without any reported errors.
