wit v@@VERSION@@ r@@REV-NEXT@@ - @@@@-@@-@@

 - "wwt ADD" accepts option "--source source" as alternative source definition.
 - The layout of "wit LIST-LLL" is redesigned:
    - Bug fix for real paths for WBFS files.
    - New option: --real-path: print the real path instead of the entered path.
    - New column: p-info: Print a short info about available partitions: "DUC?"
 - The new command "wit/wwt INFO" will inform about features. The intension is
   to inform GUIs and other wit calling programs. Therefor option --sections
   is also supported. At this moment only supported file formats inclusive
   attributes (read/write/modify/extend/fst) are printed.

Known bugs:

 - The GameCube support is in development and EXPERIMENTAL!
 - wit COPY --raw: Copying an image in raw mode to a WBFS file is buggy.
 - There are new problems while reading from non seekable sources (e.g. pipes).
   The reason is the complete new and more intelligent wiidisc lib which makes
   more lookups. I have to insert some code especially for pipes. My plans
   that copying multiple partition discs works too.
   ==> The best is to use a version 1.01c for pipes.
 - No bzip2 (WIA) support for MAC/x86_64. (bug in the bzip2 library)
