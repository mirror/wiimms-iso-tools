 - New command: wit CERT: Collect certificates and eliminate multiple entries
   of the same certificate. Dump all collected certificates to standard
   output (stdout) and/or write the certificate as binary to a file. Together
   with the new option "--fake-sign filter" is is possible to fake sign some
   or all certificates before dumping and/or storing.
 - New global option: --cert: Add certificates to the global certificate
   database. These certificates are used to check the signatures.
 - "wit dump ticket.bin tmd.bin" is now able to dump the certificate chain
   following the TICKET or TMD info. This combination is usual for 'cetk'
   and 'tmd.1234' files in WADs.
 - Workaround for Cygwin bug in /proc/partitions.
 - Bug fix for "wit CONVERT --wia" (Segmentation fault).
 - Bug fix for 'preserve time' if source is removed.
 - Command "wit LIST" supports now --progress while scanning files and dirs.
 - The old tools 'wdf-cat' and 'wdf-dump' are removed. Use instead the new
   tool 'wdf'. 'wdf' is linked to 'wdf-cat' and 'wdf-dump' to facilitate the
   old behavior when calling 'wdf-cat' or 'wdf-dump'.


Known bugs:

 - The GameCube support is in development and EXPERIMENTAL!
 - wit COPY --raw: Copying an image in raw mode to a WBFS file is buggy.
 - There are new problems while reading from non seekable sources (e.g. pipes).
   The reason is the complete new and more intelligent wiidisc lib which makes
   more lookups ==> The best is to use version 1.01c for pipes.
 - No bzip2 (WIA) support for MAC/x86_64. (bug in the bzip2 library)
