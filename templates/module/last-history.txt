 - wit+wwt SKELETON: Support of GameCube images.
 - New command: wwt DUP: Duplicate an existing WBFS to a new file including
   block assigning errors. The idea is to have a command, that can duplicate
   a defect WBFS for tests.
 - Command "wwt DUMP" accept now --show for a fine control of printed data.
   The dump may now contain also a usage table and a integrity check report.

 - Since many versions the code contains a WBFS extension. Now I have
   completed and enabled it. With this extension the WBFS "free blocks table"
   is managed in a total different way:
    - WBFS access: While opening a WBFS the free blocks table is ignored.
      Instead of using the stored one an internal memory map of used blocks is
      built. This needs only a part of a second. Some advantages:
       - Errors in the free blocks table are irrelevant.
       - Blocks overlaps and invalid block assignings are automatically
         detected, perhaps reported, and fixed for internal usage.
       - If removing a discs with overlaps, the blocks are still marked used.
       - Blocks, that are not handled by the free blocks tables (table to small,
         a result of a calculation bug in the original libwbfs) can be used.
      If closing, a new and corrected free blocks table will be written. This
      makes the whole process compatible to other WBFS managers and loaders.
    - wwt ADD: Before adding a disc it size is compared against the free size
      of the WBFS. This allows an early "disc full" error message.
    - wwt ADD: If adding a disc to a partition a continuous memory block is
      searched to minimize the (non existent) fragmentation. This disabled for
      WBFS files by default because a file itself can be fragmented. 
    - wwt ADD+PHANTOM --wbfs-alloc=mode: Set the WBFS block allocation mode.
    - The commands "wwt CHECK", "wwt REPAIR" and "wwt EDIT" have been modified
      to work with the new interface.


Known bugs:

 - There are new problems while reading from non seekable sources (e.g. pipes).
   The reason is the complete new and more intelligent wiidisc lib which makes
   more lookups ==> The best is to use version 1.01c for pipes.
