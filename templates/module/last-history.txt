 - Bug fix: "wit EDIT" failed on WBFS files since v2.10a (Write privileges
   not longer needed for WBFS files).
 - New command: wwt SCRUB: Scrubs an image and free unused WBFS blocks. It can
   be combined with --psel= to clear unwanted image partitions. This command
   may help to repair wrong block maps.
 - New wfuse option: --allow-other (-O): This option is a short cut for
   '-o allow_other'. It enables re-exporting of the mounted file system for
   example by a samba server.
