 - New command: wit IMGFILES: Print a list (1 file per line) with all image
   files inlcuding their associated split files. If option --null (-0) is set,
   the list is NULL terminated to support all possible file names.
 - New command: wit REMOVE: Removes the image files including their associated
   split files.
 - Bug fix: "wit COPY --source a --dest b" threw an error, because the tool
   thought, that no source was defined.
