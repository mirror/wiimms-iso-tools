 - Simplification of the selection of compression modes:
    - Option --compr accepts the single digit modes '0' (=NONE), '1' (=fast
      LZMA) .. '9'@ (=BEST, best LZMA).
    - Option --wia accepts an optional parameter: --wia=mode
      This is a shortcut for: --wia --compression mode
   Example: Use --wia=9 to force WIA output with compression 9=BEST.
 - wit+wwt COMPR: Layout restyled.
 - wit DUMP: Additional scrubbed size info and tabbing changes.
 - Update to Cygwin DLL release version 1.7.7-1.
 - The verbose level and log output of "wit DIFF" is now like "wit COPY".
 - New option: wit COPY --diff: Diff source and dest after copying.
 - wit COPY: If copying without modifying content option --preserve is set
   automatically.
 - Detect and dump cert.bin files.
 - Detection and status of fake signing improved. Try "wit DUMP".
 - wit DUMP image --show cert: Print ceritificate chain.
 - If dumping a ticket a tmd file, the source directory is searched for a file
   named 'cert.bin' to check the signature.


Known bugs:

 - The GameCube support is in development and EXPERIMENTAL!
 - wit COPY --raw: Copying an image in raw mode to a WBFS file is buggy.
 - There are new problems while reading from non seekable sources (e.g. pipes).
   The reason is the complete new and more intelligent wiidisc lib which makes
   more lookups ==> The best is to use version 1.01c for pipes.
 - No bzip2 (WIA) support for MAC/x86_64. (bug in the bzip2 library)
