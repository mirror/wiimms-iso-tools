 - Bug fix for "wwt EXTRACT --test": If extracting to an already existing file
   the old file was removed.
 - Bug fix for "wdf +PACK": wrong data written if packing a raw file.
 - I have made some changes in the make system to support GCC option -static
   and cross compiling (Linux/i386 on Linux/x86_64).
 - Linux/i386: Because of the static linking I can use the latest version of
   the Linux GLIBC with preallocation support. Copying file is now fast again.
 - BZIP2 support is now included as source and should work for all systems.
   This enables WIA/bzip2 support for Mac/x86_64.
 - "wit COPY/CONVERT/EXTRACT/EDIT/MOVE/DIFF" and "wwt ADD/EXTRACT/REMOVE"
   support now the option --sections.
 - "wwt add": New user interface implemented: In a first fast loop the jobs are
   counted with respect to the options like --update and --newer (ignore skiped
   files). In a second loop the jobs are executed with correct job counters.
 - wit DUMP: Scrubbing status of disc and partitions are printed. Example:
      "TICKET & TMD are well signed. Partition is encrypted and scrubbed."
 - "wit EXTARCT" failed if the disc title could not found in the title db.


Known bugs:

 - The GameCube support is in development and EXPERIMENTAL!
    - GameCube conversion to WIA fails.
 - There are new problems while reading from non seekable sources (e.g. pipes).
   The reason is the complete new and more intelligent wiidisc lib which makes
   more lookups ==> The best is to use version 1.01c for pipes.
