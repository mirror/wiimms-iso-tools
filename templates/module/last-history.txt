 - Bug fix: WBFS preallocation was always a little bit to short.
 - Bug fix: Wrong signature when dumping the content of TICKET and TMD files.
 - New option --links: Detect soft and hard linked source files while composing
   or extracting discs and try to create hard links instead of independent
   copies on the destination file system.
 - New option: --flat: If extracting files the path names of the source discs
   are removed. This enables extracting of all files to s specific destination
   directory without creation of subdirectories. Command "wit files --flat"
   can be used to verify the flat names.


Known bugs:

 - The GameCube support is in development and EXPERIMENTAL!
 - There are new problems while reading from non seekable sources (e.g. pipes).
   The reason is the complete new and more intelligent wiidisc lib which makes
   more lookups ==> The best is to use version 1.01c for pipes.
