wit v1.14a r1506 - 2010-08-09

 - Option --psel redesigned: it is now possible to allow or deny any partiton
   by partiton type, partiton table and/or by partiton index. Only with the
   unambiguous partiton index it is possible to select the one wanted DATA
   partition if multiple exists.
 - New option --rm-files: This patching option defines filter rules to remove
   real files and directories from the FST of the DATA partition. Fake signing
   of the TMD is necessary.
 - New option --zero-files: This patching option defines filter rules to zero
   (set size to zero) real files of the FST of the DATA partition. Fake
   signing$ of the TMD is necessary.
 - New option --ignore-files: This option defines filter rules to ignore
   system and real directories and files of the FST of the DATA partition.
   Fake signing is not necessary, but the partition becomes invalid, because
   the content of some files is not copied.
 - New qualifier for "wit MIX": "IGNORE ruleset": Ignore files when copying a
   disc image. See http://wit.wiimm.de/wit/cmd-mix.html#ignore for details.
 - Some modification for expanding '@file' parameters: wit MIX needs control.
 - wit MIX: A new algorithm for 2 partitions: It tries every possible shift to
   find the best overlay. All holes in both partitions are relevant.
 - wit MIX: Before creating the image a additional verify function is called.
   This function controls that no sector is used by more than one partition.
   With verbose level >=3 an usage map is printed too.

 - New "wit MIX" qualifer: HEADER: Copy the disc header (first 256 bytes of
   disc) of the related source image to the destination image. Patching with
   the options --id and --name is possible.
 - New "wit MIX" qualifer: REGION: Copy the region infor (32 Bytes at offset
   0xc4e000) of the related source image to the destination image. Patching
   with the option --region is possible.
 - Bug fix: "wit mix --name discname" didn't work.


Known bugs:

 - There are new problems while reading from non seekable sources (e.g. pipes).
   The reason is the complete new and more intelligent wiidisc lib which makes
   more lookups. I have to insert some code especially for pipes. My plans
   that copying multiple partition discs works too.
   ==> The best is to use a version 1.01c for pipes.
