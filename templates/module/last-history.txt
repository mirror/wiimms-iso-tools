wit v@@VERSION@@ r@@REV-NEXT@@ - @@@@-@@-@@

 - WIA creation warning "WIA is NEW! Compare with original source." removed.
 - Preparation: Tools will read future WDF versions without warnings, if the
   compatibility parameter allow this.
 - The file descriptor of the last WBFS partition is saved/cached. This makes
   wit faster when reading multiple discs from a WBFS.
 - wit EXTRACT: The progress view is now based on the file size instead of
   the file count.
 - Options --include and --exclude accept now IDs with wildcards:
   '.' is a wildcard for 1 character and '*' and '+' (same meaning) for any
   number of charaters.
 - File 'setup.txt' is created as template while extracting a disc image.
   It is scanned for ID, NAME and OFFSET while composing a disc image.
   The new option --ignore-setup disables the scanning of 'setup.txt'.
 - Bug fix for "wit CONVERT": The destination path was the current working
   directory.
 - Bug fix for "wwt ADD --remove": If command is done without errors all
   sources files -- but not FST -- are removed.
 - Bug fix: Calculation of fst size fixed for GameCube parsing.
 - Buf fix for "wit CONVERT": Aborting with CTRL-C don't remove the source.
 - Composed discs: New and correct calculation of total size and time stamps.
   For time stamps the newest times of all scanned files are used.
 - wit INFO FILE-FORMAT: New attribute 'compr': Signals a compressed file
   format and that option --compr can be used to setup the compression mode.
 - Splitted are also detected, if the field width of the counters is 2-6.


Known bugs:

 - The GameCube support is in development and EXPERIMENTAL!
 - wit COPY --raw: Copying an image in raw mode to a WBFS file is buggy.
 - There are new problems while reading from non seekable sources (e.g. pipes).
   The reason is the complete new and more intelligent wiidisc lib which makes
   more lookups. I have to insert some code especially for pipes. My plans
   that copying multiple partition discs works too.
   ==> The best is to use a version 1.01c for pipes.
 - No bzip2 (WIA) support for MAC/x86_64. (bug in the bzip2 library)
