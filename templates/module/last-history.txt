wit v@@VERSION@@ r@@REV-NEXT@@ - @@@@-@@-@@

 - Because no bugs (exclude installing) reported since month my WIT tools
   seems to be perfect (or ready to use or something between). So it's time
   to increase the major version and to proclaim v2.00a. The whole project
   consists about 250 000 code lines.
 - Bug fix for Windows install script: Remove duplicate WIT entries.


Known bugs:

 - The GameCube support is in development and EXPERIMENTAL!
 - There are new problems while reading from non seekable sources (e.g. pipes).
   The reason is the complete new and more intelligent wiidisc lib which makes
   more lookups ==> The best is to use version 1.01c for pipes.


Road map (for some point in the future):

 I have already stopped the development in favor of my SZS tools. But there
 are some already planned extensions:

 - Since many versions the code contains a WBFS extension, enabled by defining
   the symbol NEW_WBFS_INTERFACE (set by "make new all"). If enabled, the free
   blocks table is managed in a total different way. Already implemented are:
    - WBFS access: While opening a WBFS the free blocks table is ignored.
      Instead of using the stored one an internal memory map of used blocks is
      built. This needs only a part of a second. Some adavantages:
       - Errors in the free blocks table are irrelevant.
       - Blocks overlaps and invalid block assignings are automatically
         detected and reported.
       - If removing a discs with overlaps, the blocks are still marked used.
       - Blocks, that are not handled by the free blocks tables (a result of a
         calculation bug in the original libwbfs) can be used.
      If closing, a new (and corrected) free blocks table will be written. This
      makes the whole process compatible to other WBFS managers and loaders.
    - wwt ADD: Before adding a disc it size is compared against the free size
      of the WBFS. This allows an early "disc full" error message.
    - wwt ADD: If adding a disc a continuous memory block is searched to
      minimize the fragmentation.
   Missing:
    - Report errors while scanning the WBFS.
    - The commands "wwt CHECK", "wwt REPAIR" and "wwt EDIT" must use the new
      interface.

 - GameCube support is still incomplete.

 - There are already code fragments implemented to trim discs in three levels:
    - Move partions as whole to eliminate disc holes.
    - Move partion sectors to reduce partiton size (alternative for partition
     scrubbing). Fake signing is necessary.
    - Move files of partitons to optimize the step above.
   For all trim levels aligment factors may be set and it shuld be possible
   to set sapecial alignments for GameCube sound files.

 - On the fly patching: Create a new image a combination of 2 or more sources.
   Therefor trimming is needed.

 - A better (real) windows installer.
