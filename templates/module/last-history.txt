 - Full WDF version 2 support:
    - WDFv2 files are a little bit smaller and support alignment.
    - Parts of the WDF library have been rewritten to support WDFv2 and
      alignment. A side effect is a more compact code and a better chunk
      management if modifiying WDF files.
    - Option --wdf forces WDF output, the version is definied automatically.
    - Option --wdf1 forces WDFv1 output.
    - Option --wdf2 forces WDFv2 output.
    - Option --align-wdf defines an alignment between 1 and 1GiB (power of 2)
      and optional the minimal hole size before creating a new chunk.
    - 'wit EDIT' supports --wdf1 and --wdf2 to allow version conversions.

 - Support of split files of CleanRip: If reading a plain ISO file named
   '*.part0', the other parts are detected as continuation files.
 - Windows only: Cygwin update to v1.7.28 2014-02-09.
