 - ETA calculation changed to support WIA chunk caching and writing.
 - CYGWIN: The parameters of the options --dest and --DEST are now checked if
   they start with 'X:\' or 'X:/'. These code are replaced by '/cygdrive/X/'
 - New option: --unit: Specify the unit for size values. Some possible values
   are BYTES,KB,KIB,1000,1024,AUTO,WII. Read built in help for more details.
 - wit ISOSIZE: If option --long is not set the command uses the option --unit
   to define the unit for the ISO sizes. A summary line is also printed.

Known bugs:

 - wit COPY --raw: Copying an image in raw mode to a WBFS file is buggy.
 - There are new problems while reading from non seekable sources (e.g. pipes).
   The reason is the complete new and more intelligent wiidisc lib which makes
   more lookups. I have to insert some code especially for pipes. My plans
   that copying multiple partition discs works too.
   ==> The best is to use a version 1.01c for pipes.
 - No bzip2 (WIA) support for MAC/x86_64. (bug in the bzip2 library)
