 - WIA creation warning "WIA is NEW! Compare with original source." removed.
 - The file descriptor of the last WBFS partition is saved/cached. This makes
   wit faster when reading multiple discs from a WBFS.
 - wit EXTRACT: The progress view is now based on the file size instead of
   the file count.
 - Options --include and --exclude accept now IDs with wildcards:
   '.' is a wildcard for 1 character and '*' and '+' (same meaning) for any
   number of charaters.

Known bugs:

 - The GameCube support is in development and EXPERIMENTAL!
 - wit COPY --raw: Copying an image in raw mode to a WBFS file is buggy.
 - There are new problems while reading from non seekable sources (e.g. pipes).
   The reason is the complete new and more intelligent wiidisc lib which makes
   more lookups. I have to insert some code especially for pipes. My plans
   that copying multiple partition discs works too.
   ==> The best is to use a version 1.01c for pipes.
 - No bzip2 (WIA) support for MAC/x86_64. (bug in the bzip2 library)
