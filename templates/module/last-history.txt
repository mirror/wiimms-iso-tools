wit v@@VERSION@@ r@@REV-NEXT@@ - @@@@-@@-@@

 - ETA calculation changed to support WIA chunk caching and writing.
 - CYGWIN: The parameters of the options --dest and --DEST are now checked if
   they start with 'X:\' or 'X:/'. These code are replaced by '/cygdrive/X/'.
   This is also done for the last parameter of "wit COPY/MOVE/EXTRACT/DIFF" if
   neither --dest nor --DEST is set and the last parameter is the destination.
 - New option: --unit: Specify the unit for size values. Some possible values
   are BYTES,KB,KIB,1000,1024,AUTO,WII. Read built in help for more details.
 - wit LIST: Support of option --unit to define the unit for the ISO sizes.
 - wit ISOSIZE: Support of option --unit to define the unit for the ISO sizes.
   A summary line is also printed if the lsit contains 2 or more images.
 - Options --include and --exclude accepts now a comma separated list of IDs.
 - Bug fix: If wit had closed a WBFS partiton a truncation errors appeared.
 - New wit option: --auto: If set, all devices are scanned for WBFS partitions
   and all WBFS partitions are added to the source list. It replaces parameters
   like "--source /dev/wbfs" and works like "wwt --auto --all".


Known bugs:

 - wit COPY --raw: Copying an image in raw mode to a WBFS file is buggy.
 - There are new problems while reading from non seekable sources (e.g. pipes).
   The reason is the complete new and more intelligent wiidisc lib which makes
   more lookups. I have to insert some code especially for pipes. My plans
   that copying multiple partition discs works too.
   ==> The best is to use a version 1.01c for pipes.
 - No bzip2 (WIA) support for MAC/x86_64. (bug in the bzip2 library)
