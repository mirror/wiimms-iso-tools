 - I have made some changes in the make system to support local libraries with
   own makefiles (libbz2.a), option -static and cross compiling (Linux/i386 on
   Linux/x86_64). Hope that all work as usual.
    - BZIP2 support is now included as source and should work for all systems.
      This enables WIA/bzip2 support for Mac/x86_64.
    - The distributions of Linux/i386 and Linux/X86_64 are linked static to
      to avoid GLIBC version issues (e.g. fallocate() support).
    - On Linux/x86_64: Enter "M32=1 make ..." to create i386 binaries.
      I386 libraries and include files are needed.
 - "wit COPY/CONVERT/EXTRACT/DIFF" support option --sections.
 - Bug fix for "wwt EXTRACT --test": If extracting to an already existing file
   the old file was removed.


Known bugs:

 - The GameCube support is in development and EXPERIMENTAL!
    - GameCube conversion to WIA fails.
 - There are new problems while reading from non seekable sources (e.g. pipes).
   The reason is the complete new and more intelligent wiidisc lib which makes
   more lookups ==> The best is to use version 1.01c for pipes.
