 - wfuse --version: Print FUSE versions too.
 - New option: wfuse --create: If the mount point does not exist, create it
   and remove it on unmount.
 - New option: wfuse --remount: If the mount point is already mounted, try
   silently to unmount it first.
 - New option: --include-first: Include lists takes take precedence over
   exclude lists.
 - New option: "wwt ADD --sync-all": Use include and exclude lists only for
   creating the sync list.
 - "wit DIFF/FDIFF": The diff output was changed completly. The options
   --quit, --verbose, --file-limit, --limit, --block-size and --long allow
   fine control. The output is now homogeneously in all three modes RAW,
   SCRUBBED and FILES. Option --section is supported for each log level.
   Hidden option --OLD enables the old diff layout for compatibility.
 - New: "wdf +cmp": Compare WDF, CISO and WIA files with other sources.
 - wit DUMP: Print version of "System Menu" if update partition found.
 - There is now a Windows installer (BETA): windows-install.bat
   Please remove old selfmade installations of WIT.


Known bugs:

 - The GameCube support is in development and EXPERIMENTAL!
 - There are new problems while reading from non seekable sources (e.g. pipes).
   The reason is the complete new and more intelligent wiidisc lib which makes
   more lookups ==> The best is to use version 1.01c for pipes.
