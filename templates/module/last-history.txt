 - Preallocation of disc space implemented. It is only enabled for Cygwin by
   default. It can be disabled with --prealloc=0 or enabled with --prealloc.
   The needed preallocation function is not avaialable for mac.
 - wwt EXTRACT + REMOVE + TOUCH + VERIFY:
   These commands accept now ID6 pattern like '...P' or '+1'. Each '.' is a
   wildcard that matches any single character. A '+' matches any number of
   characters. For details see http://wit.wiimm.de/info/disc-id.html
 - wwt EXTRACT is now able to patch while extracting and to create WIA files.
   It support also the options --fst --pmode --psel --raw --files and --sneek.


Known bugs:

 - The GameCube support is in development and EXPERIMENTAL!
 - wit COPY --raw: Copying an image in raw mode to a WBFS file is buggy.
 - There are new problems while reading from non seekable sources (e.g. pipes).
   The reason is the complete new and more intelligent wiidisc lib which makes
   more lookups ==> The best is to use version 1.01c for pipes.
 - No WIA/bzip2 support for MAC/x86_64. (bug in the Mac bzip2 library)
