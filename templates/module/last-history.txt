 - The progress counter is updated more frequently while creating a WIA file.
 - Bug fix for options --one-job and --job-limit.


Known bugs:

 - The GameCube support is in development and EXPERIMENTAL!
 - wit COPY --raw: Copying an image in raw mode to a WBFS file is buggy.
 - There are new problems while reading from non seekable sources (e.g. pipes).
   The reason is the complete new and more intelligent wiidisc lib which makes
   more lookups ==> The best is to use version 1.01c for pipes.
 - No WIA/bzip2 support for MAC/x86_64. (bug in the Mac bzip2 library)
