wit v1.13a r1468 - 2010-08-04

 - Command "wit MIX" accepts now the option --overlay: Partitions will
   be overlayed so that data from one partition is stored in unused areas
   of a other partition. To find the optimum order a permutation is done.
   Option --overlay limits the number of input partitions to 12, because
   the calculation is rated as O(2^n).  *** "wit MIX" is EXPERIMENTAL! ***
 - "wit MIX" wil accept the keyword 'psel' as alternative to 'select'.
   The reason is that 'select' accepts the same keyword list as --psel.
 - The disc subsystems recognize overlayes partitons. For overlayed
   partitions the --psel keyword "WHOLE" is ignored.
 - Command "wit DUMP" will print an info line for overlayed partitions.

 - New qualifier for "wit MIX": "IGNORE ruleset": Ignore files when copying a
   disc image. See http://wit.wiimm.de/wit/cmd-mix.html#ignore for details.

Known bugs:

 - There are new problems while reading from non seekable sources (e.g. pipes).
   The reason is the complete new and more intelligent wiidisc lib which makes
   more lookups. I have to insert some code especially for pipes. My plans
   that copying multiple partition discs works too.
   ==> The best is to use a version 1.01c for pipes.
