 - New option --auto-split: If set, the tools try to find out, if an image
   split is needed. The split size is then either below 4 or 2 GiB. Auto-Split
   base on tests with fseek() and works fine under Linux, but it don't work
   with Cygwin. Mac is unknown. In future versions --auto-split is enabled by
   default. It is disabled by any other split option.
 - New option --no-split: Disable file splitting at all. At the moment and in
   old versions of the tools, this is the default.
 - wwt CHECK+REPAIR: Support for option --sections.
 - Windows only: Cygwin update to v1.7.27 2013-12-09.
