The option --sort defines the sort mode for output lists.

  Syntax: --sort sort_mode | -S sort_mode

'sort_mode' is a comma separated list of the following keywords:

    -  | NONE    : Do not sort

    IT | ITIME   : Sort by itime (insertion time)
    MT | MTIME   : Sort by mtime (last modification time)
    CT | CTIME   : Sort by ctime (last status change time)
    AT | ATIME   : Sort by atime (last access time)
    TI | TIME    : Sort by itime|mtime|atime|atime, decided by the time options.
    D  | DATE    : Alternative keyword for 'TIME'

      DEFAULT    : Use the default sort method for that output

      ASCENDING  : Sort in ascending order.
      DESCENDING : Sort in descending order (reverse).
