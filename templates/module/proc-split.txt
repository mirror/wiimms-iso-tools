Output files may be splittet into multiple files. The options --split and
--split-size controls the output splitting:

  -z --split            Enable output file splitting, default size = 4 gb.
                        4 gb means 4.000.000.000 bytes (4 billion bytes).
                        The default size for a WBFS is different. It is
                        4GiB-32KiB = 0xffff8000 = 4.294.934.528 bytes.

  -Z --split-size size  Enable output file splitting and set split size.
                        See section "Processing size options" for detailed
                        infos about the 'size' argument.

A new file is created every time when the previous one reached the split size.
Input split files are automatically detected. Only the last file of the input
split file may grow if opened in modify mode.

The split size always rounded down to a multiply of 512 (0x200), the hd sector
size. For a WBFS it is rounde down to a multiply of 32 KiB (32768, 0x8000),
the WII ISO sector size.

There are two naming schemas for the splitted files:

WBFS files are named like (defined by oggzee):
    - name.wbfs
    - name.wbf1
    - name.wbf2
      ...
    - name.wbf9
    - name.wbf10
      ...

All other files are named like:
    - name.ext
    - name.ext.1
    - name.ext.2
      ...
    - name.ext.9
    - name.ext.10
      ...

The WIT tools supports splitted WDF files *not* following the rules for
splitted WDF files. All files are splitted hard by breaking the files into
peaces. This is done by the file layer so that other layer including the WDF
layer don't see the split.

These are the rules for automatic detection of split files. The automatic
detection works only for plain files but not for other files types like
block devices or pipes:

 WBFS file:
    The last character of the filename is replaced by '1'. If a file with
    this new filename is available, the split file support is enabled.

 WDF file:
    The WDF header is read. If the current WDF files is to short and a file
    with same filename plus '.1' exists, the split file support is enabled.

 ISO file:
    If the file is smaller than 4 GiB and a file with same filename plus '.1'
    exists then then split file support is enabled.
