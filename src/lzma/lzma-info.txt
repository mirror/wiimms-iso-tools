LzmaCompress
------------

LZMA Encoder will use default values for any parameter, if it is
  -1  for any from: level, loc, lp, pb, fb, numThreads
   0  for dictSize
  
level - compression level: 0 <= level <= 9;

  level dictSize algo  fb
    0:    16 KB   0    32
    1:    64 KB   0    32
    2:   256 KB   0    32
    3:     1 MB   0    32
    4:     4 MB   0    32
    5:    16 MB   1    32
    6:    32 MB   1    32
    7+:   64 MB   1    64
 
  The default value for "level" is 5.

  algo = 0 means fast method
  algo = 1 means normal method

dictSize - The dictionary size in bytes. The maximum value is
        128 MB = (1 << 27) bytes for 32-bit version
          1 GB = (1 << 30) bytes for 64-bit version
     The default value is 16 MB = (1 << 24) bytes.
     It's recommended to use the dictionary that is larger than 4 KB and
     that can be calculated as (1 << N) or (3 << N) sizes.

lc - The number of literal context bits (high bits of previous literal).
     It can be in the range from 0 to 8. The default value is 3.
     Sometimes lc=4 gives the gain for big files.

lp - The number of literal pos bits (low bits of current position for literals).
     It can be in the range from 0 to 4. The default value is 0.
     The lp switch is intended for periodical data when the period is equal to 2^lp.
     For example, for 32-bit (4 bytes) periodical data you can use lp=2. Often it's
     better to set lc=0, if you change lp switch.

pb - The number of pos bits (low bits of current position).
     It can be in the range from 0 to 4. The default value is 2.
     The pb switch is intended for periodical data when the period is equal 2^pb.

fb - Word size (the number of fast bytes).
     It can be in the range from 5 to 273. The default value is 32.
     Usually, a big number gives a little bit better compression ratio and
     slower compression process.

numThreads - The number of thereads. 1 or 2. The default value is 2.
     Fast mode (algo = 0) can use only 1 thread.
